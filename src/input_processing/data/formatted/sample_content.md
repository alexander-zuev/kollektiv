Python Client Library
=====================

supabase-py[View on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-py)

This reference documents every object and method available in Supabase's Python library, [supabase-py](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-py)
. You can use supabase-py to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.

* * *

Installing
----------

### Install with PyPi[#](#install-with-pypi)

You can install supabase-py via the terminal. (for > Python 3.7)

PIPConda

Terminal

`     _10  pip install supabase      `

* * *

Initializing
------------

You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `create_client()` method.

The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

### Parameters

*   supabase\_urlRequiredstring
    
    The unique Supabase URL which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
    
*   supabase\_keyRequiredstring
    
    The unique Supabase Key which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
    
*   optionsOptionalClientOptions
    
    Options to change the Auth behaviors.
    
    Details
    

create\_client()With timeout option

`     _10  import os  _10  from supabase import create_client, Client  _10  _10  url: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_URL")  _10  key: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_KEY")  _10  supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)      `

* * *

Fetch data
----------

*   By default, Supabase projects return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in your project's [API settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)
    . It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
*   `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/python/using-filters)
    
*   `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/python/using-modifiers)
    
*   `apikey` is a reserved keyword if you're using the [Supabase Platform](/docs/guides/platform)
     and [should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465)
    .

### Parameters

*   columnsOptionalstring
    
    The columns to retrieve, defaults to `*`.
    
*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    The property to use to get the count of rows returned.

Delete data
-----------

*   `delete()` should always be combined with [filters](/docs/reference/python/using-filters)
     to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
*   If you use `delete()` with filters and you have [RLS](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security)
     enabled, only rows visible through `SELECT` policies are deleted. Note that by default no rows are visible, so you need at least one `SELECT`/`ALL` policy that makes the rows visible.
*   When using `delete().in_()`, specify an array of values to target multiple rows with a single query. This is particularly useful for batch deleting entries that share common criteria, such as deleting users by their IDs. Ensure that the array you provide accurately represents all records you intend to delete to avoid unintended data removal.

### Parameters

*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    The property to use to get the count of rows returned.
    
*   returningOptionalReturnMethod
    
    Either 'minimal' or 'representation'. Defaults to 'representation'.

Call a Postgres function
------------------------

You can call Postgres functions as _Remote Procedure Calls_, logic in your database that you can execute from anywhere. Functions are useful when the logic rarely changesâ€”like for password resets and updates.

`     _10  create or replace function hello_world() returns text as $$  _10  select 'Hello world';  _10  $$ language sql;      `

### Parameters

*   fnRequiredcallable
    
    The stored procedure call to be executed.
    
*   paramsOptionaldict of any
    
    Parameters passed into the stored procedure call.
    
*   getOptionaldict of any
    
    When set to `true`, `data` will not be returned. Useful if you only need the count.
    
*   headOptionaldict of any
    
    When set to `true`, the function will be called with read-only access mode.
    
*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    Count algorithm to use to count rows returned by the function. Only applicable for [set-returning functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-srf.html)
    . `"exact"`: Exact but slow count algorithm. Performs a `COUNT(*)` under the hood. `"planned"`: Approximated but fast count algorithm. Uses the Postgres statistics under the hood. `"estimated"`: Uses exact count for low numbers and planned count for high numbers.

Using filters
-------------

Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`, and `delete()` queries.

If a Postgres function returns a table response, you can also apply filters.

Data source

Response

* * *

Using modifiers
---------------

Filters work on the row levelâ€”they allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definitionâ€”allowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that returns a table response).

* * *

Order the results
-----------------

Order the query result by `column`.

### Parameters

*   columnRequiredstring
    
    The column to order by
    
*   descOptionalbool
    
    Whether the rows should be ordered in descending order or not.
    
*   foreign\_tableOptionalstring
    
    Foreign table name whose results are to be ordered.
    
*   nullsfirstOptionalbool
    
    Order by showing nulls first
    

With \`select()\`On a foreign table

`     _10  response = (  _10  supabase.table("countries")  _10  .select("*")  _10  .order("name", desc=True)  _10  .execute()  _10  )      `

Limit the number of rows returned
---------------------------------

### Parameters

*   sizeRequirednumber
    
    The maximum number of rows to return
    
*   foreign\_tableOptionalstring
    
    Set this to limit rows of foreign tables instead of the parent table.
    

With \`select()\`On a foreign table

`     _10  response = supabase.table("countries").select("name").limit(1).execute()      `

Data source

Response

* * *

Limit the query to a range
--------------------------

Limit the query result by starting at an offset (`from`) and ending at the offset (`from + to`). Only records within this range are returned. This respects the query order and if there is no order clause the range could behave unexpectedly.

The `from` and `to` values are 0-based and inclusive: `range(1, 3)` will include the second, third and fourth rows of the query.

### Parameters

*   startRequirednumber
    
    The starting index from which to limit the result.

Using explain
-------------

For debugging slow queries, you can get the [Postgres `EXPLAIN` execution plan](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html)
 of a query using the `explain()` method. This works on any query, even for `rpc()` or writes.

Explain is not enabled by default as it can reveal sensitive information about your database. It's best to only enable this for testing environments but if you wish to enable it for production you can provide additional protection by using a `pre-request` function.

Follow the [Performance Debugging Guide](/docs/guides/database/debugging-performance)
 to enable the functionality on your project.

### Parameters

*   walOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on WAL record generation.
    
*   verboseOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, the query identifier will be returned and `data` will include the output columns of the query.
    
*   settingsOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on configuration parameters that affect query planning.
    
*   formatOptionalboolean
    
    The format of the output, can be `"text"` (default) or `"json"`.
    
*   formatOptional"text" | "json"
    
    The format of the output, can be `"text"` (default) or `"json"`.
    
*   buffersOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on buffer usage.
    
*   analyzeOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, the query will be executed and the actual run time will be returned.

Create a new user
-----------------

*   By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
    .
*   **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
    *   If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
    *   If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
*   By default, when the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls)
    . You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration)
    .
*   If sign\_up() is called for an existing confirmed user:
    *   When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
        , an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
    *   When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
*   To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to [`get_user()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-getuser)
    .

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignUpWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign up with an email and passwordSign up with a phone number and password (SMS)Sign up with a phone number and password (whatsapp)Sign up with additional user metadataSign up with a redirect URL

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_up(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "password": "password"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Create an anonymous user
------------------------

*   Returns an anonymous user
*   It is recommended to set up captcha for anonymous sign-ins to prevent abuse. You can pass in the captcha token in the `options` param.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInAnonymouslyCredentials
    
    Details
    

Create an anonymous userCreate an anonymous user with custom user metadata

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_anonymously(  _10  {"options": {"captcha_token": ""}}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in a user
--------------

Log in an existing user with an email and password or phone and password.

*   Requires either an email and password or a phone number and password.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with email and passwordSign in with phone and password

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_password(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "password": "example-password"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in with ID Token
---------------------

Allows signing in with an OIDC ID token. The authentication provider used should be enabled and configured.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithIdTokenCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign In using ID Token

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_id_token(  _10  {"provider": "google", "token": "your-id-token"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in a user through OTP
--------------------------

*   Requires either an email or phone number.
*   This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
*   If the user doesn't exist, `sign_in_with_otp()` will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set `should_create_user` in `SignInWithPasswordlessCredentials.options` to `false`.
*   If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
*   If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
*   The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls)
    .
*   See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth/overview#redirect-urls-and-wildcards)
     to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
*   Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link, [modify the magic link email template](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates)
     to include `\{\{ .Token \}\}` instead of `\{\{ .ConfirmationURL \}\}`.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with emailSign in with SMS OTPSign in with WhatsApp OTP

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_otp(  _10  {  _10  "email": "email@example.com",  _10  "options": {"email_redirect_to": "https://example.com/welcome"},  _10  }  _10  )      `

Notes

* * *

Sign in a user through OAuth
----------------------------

*   This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
*   Supabase supports many different [third-party providers](/docs/guides/auth#configure-third-party-providers)
    .

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithOAuthCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in using a third-party providerSign in using a third-party provider with redirectSign in with scopes

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_oauth({  _10  "provider": 'github'  _10  })      `

* * *

Sign in a user through SSO
--------------------------

*   Before you can call this method you need to [establish a connection](/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml#managing-saml-20-connections)
     to an identity provider. Use the [CLI commands](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-sso)
     to do this.
*   If you've associated an email domain to the identity provider, you can use the `domain` property to start a sign-in flow.
*   In case you need to use a different way to start the authentication flow with an identity provider, you can use the `provider_id` property. For example:
    *   Mapping specific user email addresses with an identity provider.
    *   Using different hints to identity the identity provider to be used by the user, like a company-specific page, IP address or other tracking information.

### Parameters

*   paramsRequiredSignInWithSSOCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with email domainSign in with provider UUID

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_sso({"domain": "company.com"})      `

Response

Notes

* * *

Sign out a user
---------------

*   In order to use the `sign_out()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
*   By default, `sign_out()` uses the global scope, which signs out all other sessions that the user is logged into as well.
*   Since Supabase Auth uses JWTs for authentication, the access token JWT will be valid until it's expired. When the user signs out, Supabase revokes the refresh token and deletes the JWT from the client-side. This does not revoke the JWT and it will still be valid until it expires.

### Parameters

*   optionsOptionalSignOutOptions
    
    Details
    

Sign out

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_out()      `

* * *

Verify and log in through OTP
-----------------------------

*   The `verify_otp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `email`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change` (`signup` and `magiclink` types are deprecated).
*   The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verify_otp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
*   The `TokenHash` is contained in the [email templates](/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates)
     and can be used to sign in. You may wish to use the hash with Magic Links for the PKCE flow for Server Side Auth. See [this guide](/docs/guides/auth/server-side/email-based-auth-with-pkce-flow-for-ssr)
     for more details.

### Parameters

*   paramsRequiredVerifyOtpParams
    
    Details
    

Verify Signup One-Time Password (OTP)Verify SMS One-Time Password (OTP)Verify Email Auth (Token Hash)

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.verify_otp(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "token": "123456", "type": "email"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a session
------------------

*   This method retrieves the current local session (i.e in memory).
*   The session contains a signed JWT and unencoded session data.
*   Since the unencoded session data is retrieved from the local storage medium, **do not** rely on it as a source of trusted data on the server. It could be tampered with by the sender. If you need verified, trustworthy user data, call [`get_user`](/docs/reference/python/auth-getuser)
     instead.
*   If the session has an expired access token, this method will use the refresh token to get a new session.

Get the session data

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.get_session()      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a new session
----------------------

Returns a new session, regardless of expiry status. Takes in an optional refresh token. If not passed in, then refresh\_session() will attempt to retrieve it from get\_session(). If the current session's refresh token is invalid, an error will be thrown.

*   This method will refresh the session whether the current one is expired or not.

### Parameters

*   refresh\_tokenOptionalstring
    

Refresh session using the current session

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.refresh_session()      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a user
---------------

*   This method fetches the user object from the database instead of local session.
*   This method is useful for checking if the user is authorized because it validates the user's access token JWT on the server.

### Parameters

*   jwtOptionalstring
    
    Takes in an optional access token JWT. If no JWT is provided, the JWT from the current session is used.
    

Get the logged in user with the current existing sessionGet the logged in user with a custom access token jwt

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.get_user()      `

Response

* * *

Set the session data
--------------------

Sets the session data from the current session. If the current session is expired, setSession will take care of refreshing it to obtain a new session. If the refresh token or access token in the current session is invalid, an error will be thrown.

*   This method sets the session using an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
*   If successful, a `SIGNED_IN` event is emitted.

### Parameters

*   access\_tokenRequiredstring
    
*   refresh\_tokenRequiredstring
    

Refresh the session

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.set_session(access_token, refresh_token)      `

Response

Notes

Auth MFA
--------

This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace.

Currently, we only support time-based one-time password (TOTP) as the 2nd factor. We don't support recovery codes but we allow users to enroll more than 1 TOTP factor, with an upper limit of 10.

Having a 2nd TOTP factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup TOTP factor.

* * *

Enroll a factor
---------------

*   Currently, `totp` is the only supported `factor_type`. The returned `id` should be used to create a challenge.
*   To create a challenge, see [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
    .
*   To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
    .
*   To create and verify a challenge in a single step, see [`mfa.challenge_and_verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challengeandverify)
    .

Enroll a time-based, one-time password (TOTP) factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.enroll({  _10  "factor_type": "totp",  _10  "friendly_name": "your_friendly_name"  _10  })      `

* * *

Create a challenge
------------------

*   An [enrolled factor](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-enroll)
     is required before creating a challenge.
*   To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
    .

Create a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.challenge({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225'  _10  })      `

* * *

Verify a challenge
------------------

*   To verify a challenge, please [create a challenge](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
     first.

Verify a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.verify({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  "challenge_id": '4034ae6f-a8ce-4fb5-8ee5-69a5863a7c15',  _10  "code": '123456'  _10  })      `

* * *

Create and verify a challenge
-----------------------------

*   An [enrolled factor](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-enroll)
     is required before invoking `challengeAndVerify()`.
*   Executes [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
     and [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
     in a single step.

Create and verify a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.challenge_and_verify({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  "code": '123456'  _10  })      `

* * *

Unenroll a factor
-----------------

Unenroll a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  })      `

* * *

Get Authenticator Assurance Level
---------------------------------

*   Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is the measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism.
*   In Supabase, having an AAL of `aal1` refers to having the 1st factor of authentication such as an email and password or OAuth sign-in while `aal2` refers to the 2nd factor of authentication such as a time-based, one-time-password (TOTP).
*   If the user has a verified factor, the `next_level` field will return `aal2`, else, it will return `aal1`.

Get the AAL details of a session

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.get_authenticator_assurance_level()      `

* * *

Invokes a Supabase Edge Function.
---------------------------------

Invoke a Supabase Function.

*   Requires an Authorization header.
*   When you pass in a body to your function, we automatically attach the Content-Type header for `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, `File`, `FormData` and `String`. If it doesn't match any of these types we assume the payload is `json`, serialise it and attach the `Content-Type` header as `application/json`. You can override this behaviour by passing in a `Content-Type` header of your own.

Basic invocationError handlingPassing custom headers

`     _10  response = supabase.functions.invoke(  _10  "hello-world", invoke_options={"body": {"name": "Functions"}}  _10  )      `

* * *

Subscribe to channel
--------------------

*   By default, Broadcast and Presence are enabled for all projects.
*   By default, listening to database changes is disabled for new projects due to database performance and security concerns. You can turn it on by managing Realtime's [replication](/docs/guides/api#realtime-api-overview)
    .
*   You can receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes by setting the table's `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` (e.g., `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`).
*   Row level security is not applied to delete statements. When RLS is enabled and replica identity is set to full, only the primary key is sent to clients.

* * *

Unsubscribe from a channel
--------------------------

*   Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.

Python Client Library
=====================

supabase-py[View on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-py)

This reference documents every object and method available in Supabase's Python library, [supabase-py](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-py)
. You can use supabase-py to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.

* * *

Installing
----------

### Install with PyPi[#](#install-with-pypi)

You can install supabase-py via the terminal. (for > Python 3.7)

PIPConda

Terminal

`     _10  pip install supabase      `

* * *

Initializing
------------

You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `create_client()` method.

The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

### Parameters

*   supabase\_urlRequiredstring
    
    The unique Supabase URL which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
    
*   supabase\_keyRequiredstring
    
    The unique Supabase Key which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
    
*   optionsOptionalClientOptions
    
    Options to change the Auth behaviors.
    
    Details
    

create\_client()With timeout option

`     _10  import os  _10  from supabase import create_client, Client  _10  _10  url: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_URL")  _10  key: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_KEY")  _10  supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)      `

* * *

Fetch data
----------

*   By default, Supabase projects return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in your project's [API settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)
    . It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
*   `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/python/using-filters)
    
*   `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/python/using-modifiers)
    
*   `apikey` is a reserved keyword if you're using the [Supabase Platform](/docs/guides/platform)
     and [should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465)
    .

### Parameters

*   columnsOptionalstring
    
    The columns to retrieve, defaults to `*`.
    
*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    The property to use to get the count of rows returned.

Delete data
-----------

*   `delete()` should always be combined with [filters](/docs/reference/python/using-filters)
     to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
*   If you use `delete()` with filters and you have [RLS](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security)
     enabled, only rows visible through `SELECT` policies are deleted. Note that by default no rows are visible, so you need at least one `SELECT`/`ALL` policy that makes the rows visible.
*   When using `delete().in_()`, specify an array of values to target multiple rows with a single query. This is particularly useful for batch deleting entries that share common criteria, such as deleting users by their IDs. Ensure that the array you provide accurately represents all records you intend to delete to avoid unintended data removal.

### Parameters

*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    The property to use to get the count of rows returned.
    
*   returningOptionalReturnMethod
    
    Either 'minimal' or 'representation'. Defaults to 'representation'.

Call a Postgres function
------------------------

You can call Postgres functions as _Remote Procedure Calls_, logic in your database that you can execute from anywhere. Functions are useful when the logic rarely changesâ€”like for password resets and updates.

`     _10  create or replace function hello_world() returns text as $$  _10  select 'Hello world';  _10  $$ language sql;      `

### Parameters

*   fnRequiredcallable
    
    The stored procedure call to be executed.
    
*   paramsOptionaldict of any
    
    Parameters passed into the stored procedure call.
    
*   getOptionaldict of any
    
    When set to `true`, `data` will not be returned. Useful if you only need the count.
    
*   headOptionaldict of any
    
    When set to `true`, the function will be called with read-only access mode.
    
*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    Count algorithm to use to count rows returned by the function. Only applicable for [set-returning functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-srf.html)
    . `"exact"`: Exact but slow count algorithm. Performs a `COUNT(*)` under the hood. `"planned"`: Approximated but fast count algorithm. Uses the Postgres statistics under the hood. `"estimated"`: Uses exact count for low numbers and planned count for high numbers.

Using filters
-------------

Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`, and `delete()` queries.

If a Postgres function returns a table response, you can also apply filters.

Using modifiers
---------------

Filters work on the row levelâ€”they allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definitionâ€”allowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that returns a table response).

* * *

Order the results
-----------------

Order the query result by `column`.

### Parameters

*   columnRequiredstring
    
    The column to order by
    
*   descOptionalbool
    
    Whether the rows should be ordered in descending order or not.
    
*   foreign\_tableOptionalstring

Data source

Response

* * *

Limit the query to a range
--------------------------

Limit the query result by starting at an offset (`from`) and ending at the offset (`from + to`). Only records within this range are returned. This respects the query order and if there is no order clause the range could behave unexpectedly.

The `from` and `to` values are 0-based and inclusive: `range(1, 3)` will include the second, third and fourth rows of the query.

### Parameters

*   startRequirednumber
    
    The starting index from which to limit the result.
    
*   endRequirednumber
    
    The last index to which to limit the result.
    
*   foreign\_tableOptionalstring
    
    Set this to limit rows of foreign tables instead of the parent table.

Using explain
-------------

For debugging slow queries, you can get the [Postgres `EXPLAIN` execution plan](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html)
 of a query using the `explain()` method. This works on any query, even for `rpc()` or writes.

Explain is not enabled by default as it can reveal sensitive information about your database. It's best to only enable this for testing environments but if you wish to enable it for production you can provide additional protection by using a `pre-request` function.

Follow the [Performance Debugging Guide](/docs/guides/database/debugging-performance)
 to enable the functionality on your project.

### Parameters

*   walOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on WAL record generation.
    
*   verboseOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, the query identifier will be returned and `data` will include the output columns of the query.
    
*   settingsOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on configuration parameters that affect query planning.
    
*   formatOptionalboolean
    
    The format of the output, can be `"text"` (default) or `"json"`.
    
*   formatOptional"text" | "json"
    
    The format of the output, can be `"text"` (default) or `"json"`.
    
*   buffersOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on buffer usage.
    
*   analyzeOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, the query will be executed and the actual run time will be returned.

Create a new user
-----------------

*   By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
    .
*   **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
    *   If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
    *   If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
*   By default, when the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls)
    . You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration)
    .
*   If sign\_up() is called for an existing confirmed user:
    *   When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
        , an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
    *   When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
*   To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to [`get_user()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-getuser)
    .

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignUpWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign up with an email and passwordSign up with a phone number and password (SMS)Sign up with a phone number and password (whatsapp)Sign up with additional user metadataSign up with a redirect URL

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_up(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "password": "password"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Create an anonymous user
------------------------

*   Returns an anonymous user
*   It is recommended to set up captcha for anonymous sign-ins to prevent abuse. You can pass in the captcha token in the `options` param.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInAnonymouslyCredentials
    
    Details
    

Create an anonymous userCreate an anonymous user with custom user metadata

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_anonymously(  _10  {"options": {"captcha_token": ""}}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in a user
--------------

Log in an existing user with an email and password or phone and password.

*   Requires either an email and password or a phone number and password.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with email and passwordSign in with phone and password

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_password(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "password": "example-password"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in with ID Token
---------------------

Allows signing in with an OIDC ID token. The authentication provider used should be enabled and configured.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithIdTokenCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign In using ID Token

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_id_token(  _10  {"provider": "google", "token": "your-id-token"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in a user through OTP
--------------------------

*   Requires either an email or phone number.
*   This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
*   If the user doesn't exist, `sign_in_with_otp()` will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set `should_create_user` in `SignInWithPasswordlessCredentials.options` to `false`.
*   If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
*   If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
*   The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls)
    .
*   See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth/overview#redirect-urls-and-wildcards)
     to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
*   Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link, [modify the magic link email template](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates)
     to include `\{\{ .Token \}\}` instead of `\{\{ .ConfirmationURL \}\}`.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with emailSign in with SMS OTPSign in with WhatsApp OTP

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_otp(  _10  {  _10  "email": "email@example.com",  _10  "options": {"email_redirect_to": "https://example.com/welcome"},  _10  }  _10  )      `

Response

Notes

* * *

Sign in a user through OAuth
----------------------------

*   This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
*   Supabase supports many different [third-party providers](/docs/guides/auth#configure-third-party-providers)
    .

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithOAuthCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in using a third-party providerSign in using a third-party provider with redirectSign in with scopes

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_oauth({  _10  "provider": 'github'  _10  })      `

* * *

Sign in a user through SSO
--------------------------

*   Before you can call this method you need to [establish a connection](/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml#managing-saml-20-connections)
     to an identity provider. Use the [CLI commands](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-sso)
     to do this.
*   If you've associated an email domain to the identity provider, you can use the `domain` property to start a sign-in flow.
*   In case you need to use a different way to start the authentication flow with an identity provider, you can use the `provider_id` property. For example:
    *   Mapping specific user email addresses with an identity provider.
    *   Using different hints to identity the identity provider to be used by the user, like a company-specific page, IP address or other tracking information.

### Parameters

*   paramsRequiredSignInWithSSOCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with email domainSign in with provider UUID

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_sso({"domain": "company.com"})      `

Response

Notes

* * *

Sign out a user
---------------

*   In order to use the `sign_out()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
*   By default, `sign_out()` uses the global scope, which signs out all other sessions that the user is logged into as well.
*   Since Supabase Auth uses JWTs for authentication, the access token JWT will be valid until it's expired. When the user signs out, Supabase revokes the refresh token and deletes the JWT from the client-side. This does not revoke the JWT and it will still be valid until it expires.

### Parameters

*   optionsOptionalSignOutOptions
    
    Details
    

Sign out

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_out()      `

* * *

Verify and log in through OTP
-----------------------------

*   The `verify_otp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `email`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change` (`signup` and `magiclink` types are deprecated).
*   The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verify_otp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
*   The `TokenHash` is contained in the [email templates](/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates)
     and can be used to sign in. You may wish to use the hash with Magic Links for the PKCE flow for Server Side Auth. See [this guide](/docs/guides/auth/server-side/email-based-auth-with-pkce-flow-for-ssr)
     for more details.

### Parameters

*   paramsRequiredVerifyOtpParams
    
    Details
    

Verify Signup One-Time Password (OTP)Verify SMS One-Time Password (OTP)Verify Email Auth (Token Hash)

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.verify_otp(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "token": "123456", "type": "email"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a session
------------------

*   This method retrieves the current local session (i.e in memory).
*   The session contains a signed JWT and unencoded session data.
*   Since the unencoded session data is retrieved from the local storage medium, **do not** rely on it as a source of trusted data on the server. It could be tampered with by the sender. If you need verified, trustworthy user data, call [`get_user`](/docs/reference/python/auth-getuser)
     instead.
*   If the session has an expired access token, this method will use the refresh token to get a new session.

Get the session data

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.get_session()      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a new session
----------------------

Returns a new session, regardless of expiry status. Takes in an optional refresh token. If not passed in, then refresh\_session() will attempt to retrieve it from get\_session(). If the current session's refresh token is invalid, an error will be thrown.

*   This method will refresh the session whether the current one is expired or not.

### Parameters

*   refresh\_tokenOptionalstring
    

Refresh session using the current session

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.refresh_session()      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a user
---------------

*   This method fetches the user object from the database instead of local session.
*   This method is useful for checking if the user is authorized because it validates the user's access token JWT on the server.

### Parameters

*   jwtOptionalstring
    
    Takes in an optional access token JWT. If no JWT is provided, the JWT from the current session is used.
    

Get the logged in user with the current existing sessionGet the logged in user with a custom access token jwt

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.get_user()      `

Response

* * *

Set the session data
--------------------

Sets the session data from the current session. If the current session is expired, setSession will take care of refreshing it to obtain a new session. If the refresh token or access token in the current session is invalid, an error will be thrown.

*   This method sets the session using an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
*   If successful, a `SIGNED_IN` event is emitted.

### Parameters

*   access\_tokenRequiredstring
    
*   refresh\_tokenRequiredstring
    

Refresh the session

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.set_session(access_token, refresh_token)      `

Response

Notes

Auth MFA
--------

This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace.

Currently, we only support time-based one-time password (TOTP) as the 2nd factor. We don't support recovery codes but we allow users to enroll more than 1 TOTP factor, with an upper limit of 10.

Having a 2nd TOTP factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup TOTP factor.

* * *

Enroll a factor
---------------

*   Currently, `totp` is the only supported `factor_type`. The returned `id` should be used to create a challenge.
*   To create a challenge, see [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
    .
*   To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
    .
*   To create and verify a challenge in a single step, see [`mfa.challenge_and_verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challengeandverify)
    .

Enroll a time-based, one-time password (TOTP) factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.enroll({  _10  "factor_type": "totp",  _10  "friendly_name": "your_friendly_name"  _10  })      `

* * *

Create a challenge
------------------

*   An [enrolled factor](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-enroll)
     is required before creating a challenge.
*   To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
    .

Create a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.challenge({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225'  _10  })      `

* * *

Verify a challenge
------------------

*   To verify a challenge, please [create a challenge](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
     first.

Verify a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.verify({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  "challenge_id": '4034ae6f-a8ce-4fb5-8ee5-69a5863a7c15',  _10  "code": '123456'  _10  })      `

* * *

Create and verify a challenge
-----------------------------

*   An [enrolled factor](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-enroll)
     is required before invoking `challengeAndVerify()`.
*   Executes [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
     and [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
     in a single step.

Create and verify a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.challenge_and_verify({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  "code": '123456'  _10  })      `

* * *

Unenroll a factor
-----------------

Unenroll a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  })      `

* * *

Get Authenticator Assurance Level
---------------------------------

*   Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is the measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism.
*   In Supabase, having an AAL of `aal1` refers to having the 1st factor of authentication such as an email and password or OAuth sign-in while `aal2` refers to the 2nd factor of authentication such as a time-based, one-time-password (TOTP).
*   If the user has a verified factor, the `next_level` field will return `aal2`, else, it will return `aal1`.

Get the AAL details of a session

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.get_authenticator_assurance_level()      `

* * *

Invokes a Supabase Edge Function.
---------------------------------

Invoke a Supabase Function.

*   Requires an Authorization header.
*   When you pass in a body to your function, we automatically attach the Content-Type header for `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, `File`, `FormData` and `String`. If it doesn't match any of these types we assume the payload is `json`, serialise it and attach the `Content-Type` header as `application/json`. You can override this behaviour by passing in a `Content-Type` header of your own.

Basic invocationError handlingPassing custom headers

`     _10  response = supabase.functions.invoke(  _10  "hello-world", invoke_options={"body": {"name": "Functions"}}  _10  )      `

* * *

Subscribe to channel
--------------------

*   By default, Broadcast and Presence are enabled for all projects.
*   By default, listening to database changes is disabled for new projects due to database performance and security concerns. You can turn it on by managing Realtime's [replication](/docs/guides/api#realtime-api-overview)
    .
*   You can receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes by setting the table's `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` (e.g., `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`).
*   Row level security is not applied to delete statements. When RLS is enabled and replica identity is set to full, only the primary key is sent to clients.

* * *

Unsubscribe from a channel
--------------------------

*   Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.

Python Client Library
=====================

supabase-py[View on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-py)

This reference documents every object and method available in Supabase's Python library, [supabase-py](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-py)
. You can use supabase-py to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.

* * *

Installing
----------

### Install with PyPi[#](#install-with-pypi)

You can install supabase-py via the terminal. (for > Python 3.7)

PIPConda

Terminal

`     _10  pip install supabase      `

* * *

Initializing
------------

You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `create_client()` method.

The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

### Parameters

*   supabase\_urlRequiredstring
    
    The unique Supabase URL which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
    
*   supabase\_keyRequiredstring
    
    The unique Supabase Key which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.
    
*   optionsOptionalClientOptions
    
    Options to change the Auth behaviors.
    
    Details
    

create\_client()With timeout option

`     _10  import os  _10  from supabase import create_client, Client  _10  _10  url: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_URL")  _10  key: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_KEY")  _10  supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)      `

* * *

Fetch data
----------

*   By default, Supabase projects return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in your project's [API settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)
    . It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
*   `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/python/using-filters)
    
*   `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/python/using-modifiers)
    
*   `apikey` is a reserved keyword if you're using the [Supabase Platform](/docs/guides/platform)
     and [should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465)
    .

### Parameters

*   columnsOptionalstring
    
    The columns to retrieve, defaults to `*`.
    
*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    The property to use to get the count of rows returned.

Delete data
-----------

*   `delete()` should always be combined with [filters](/docs/reference/python/using-filters)
     to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
*   If you use `delete()` with filters and you have [RLS](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security)
     enabled, only rows visible through `SELECT` policies are deleted. Note that by default no rows are visible, so you need at least one `SELECT`/`ALL` policy that makes the rows visible.
*   When using `delete().in_()`, specify an array of values to target multiple rows with a single query. This is particularly useful for batch deleting entries that share common criteria, such as deleting users by their IDs. Ensure that the array you provide accurately represents all records you intend to delete to avoid unintended data removal.

### Parameters

*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    The property to use to get the count of rows returned.
    
*   returningOptionalReturnMethod
    
    Either 'minimal' or 'representation'. Defaults to 'representation'.

Call a Postgres function
------------------------

You can call Postgres functions as _Remote Procedure Calls_, logic in your database that you can execute from anywhere. Functions are useful when the logic rarely changesâ€”like for password resets and updates.

`     _10  create or replace function hello_world() returns text as $$  _10  select 'Hello world';  _10  $$ language sql;      `

### Parameters

*   fnRequiredcallable
    
    The stored procedure call to be executed.
    
*   paramsOptionaldict of any
    
    Parameters passed into the stored procedure call.
    
*   getOptionaldict of any
    
    When set to `true`, `data` will not be returned. Useful if you only need the count.
    
*   headOptionaldict of any
    
    When set to `true`, the function will be called with read-only access mode.
    
*   countOptionalCountMethod
    
    Count algorithm to use to count rows returned by the function. Only applicable for [set-returning functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-srf.html)
    . `"exact"`: Exact but slow count algorithm. Performs a `COUNT(*)` under the hood. `"planned"`: Approximated but fast count algorithm. Uses the Postgres statistics under the hood. `"estimated"`: Uses exact count for low numbers and planned count for high numbers.

Using filters
-------------

Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`, and `delete()` queries.

If a Postgres function returns a table response, you can also apply filters.

* * *

Using modifiers
---------------

Filters work on the row levelâ€”they allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definitionâ€”allowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that returns a table response).

* * *

Order the results
-----------------

Order the query result by `column`.

### Parameters

*   columnRequiredstring
    
    The column to order by
    
*   descOptionalbool
    
    Whether the rows should be ordered in descending order or not.
    
*   foreign\_tableOptionalstring
    
    Foreign table name whose results are to be ordered.
    
*   nullsfirstOptionalbool
    
    Order by showing nulls first
    

With \`select()\`On a foreign table

`     _10  response = (  _10  supabase.table("countries")  _10  .select("*")  _10  .order("name", desc=True)  _10  .execute()  _10  )      `

Data source

Response

* * *

Limit the number of rows returned
---------------------------------

### Parameters

*   sizeRequirednumber
    
    The maximum number of rows to return
    
*   foreign\_tableOptionalstring
    
    Set this to limit rows of foreign tables instead of the parent table.
    

With \`select()\`On a foreign table

`     _10  response = supabase.table("countries").select("name").limit(1).execute()      `

Data source

Response

* * *

Limit the query to a range
--------------------------

Limit the query result by starting at an offset (`from`) and ending at the offset (`from + to`). Only records within this range are returned. This respects the query order and if there is no order clause the range could behave unexpectedly.

The `from` and `to` values are 0-based and inclusive: `range(1, 3)` will include the second, third and fourth rows of the query.

### Parameters

*   startRequirednumber
    
    The starting index from which to limit the result.
    
*   endRequirednumber
    
    The last index to which to limit the result.
    
*   foreign\_tableOptionalstring
    
    Set this to limit rows of foreign tables instead of the parent table.
    

With \`select()\`On a foreign table

`     _10  response = supabase.table("countries").select("name").range(0, 1).execute()      `

Data source

Response

* * *

Retrieve one row of data
------------------------

Return `data` as a single object instead of an array of objects.

With \`select()\`

`     _10  response = supabase.table("countries").select("name").limit(1).single().execute()      `

Notes

* * *

Using explain
-------------

For debugging slow queries, you can get the [Postgres `EXPLAIN` execution plan](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html)
 of a query using the `explain()` method. This works on any query, even for `rpc()` or writes.

Explain is not enabled by default as it can reveal sensitive information about your database. It's best to only enable this for testing environments but if you wish to enable it for production you can provide additional protection by using a `pre-request` function.

Follow the [Performance Debugging Guide](/docs/guides/database/debugging-performance)
 to enable the functionality on your project.

### Parameters

*   walOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on WAL record generation.
    
*   verboseOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, the query identifier will be returned and `data` will include the output columns of the query.
    
*   settingsOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on configuration parameters that affect query planning.
    
*   formatOptionalboolean
    
    The format of the output, can be `"text"` (default) or `"json"`.
    
*   formatOptional"text" | "json"
    
    The format of the output, can be `"text"` (default) or `"json"`.
    
*   buffersOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, include information on buffer usage.
    
*   analyzeOptionalboolean
    
    If `true`, the query will be executed and the actual run time will be returned.

Notes

* * *

Create a new user
-----------------

*   By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
    .
*   **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
    *   If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
    *   If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
*   By default, when the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls)
    . You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration)
    .
*   If sign\_up() is called for an existing confirmed user:
    *   When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
        , an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
    *   When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
*   To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to [`get_user()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-getuser)
    .

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignUpWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign up with an email and passwordSign up with a phone number and password (SMS)Sign up with a phone number and password (whatsapp)Sign up with additional user metadataSign up with a redirect URL

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_up(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "password": "password"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Create an anonymous user
------------------------

*   Returns an anonymous user
*   It is recommended to set up captcha for anonymous sign-ins to prevent abuse. You can pass in the captcha token in the `options` param.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInAnonymouslyCredentials
    
    Details
    

Create an anonymous userCreate an anonymous user with custom user metadata

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_anonymously(  _10  {"options": {"captcha_token": ""}}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in a user
--------------

Log in an existing user with an email and password or phone and password.

*   Requires either an email and password or a phone number and password.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with email and passwordSign in with phone and password

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_password(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "password": "example-password"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in with ID Token
---------------------

Allows signing in with an OIDC ID token. The authentication provider used should be enabled and configured.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithIdTokenCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign In using ID Token

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_id_token(  _10  {"provider": "google", "token": "your-id-token"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Sign in a user through OTP
--------------------------

*   Requires either an email or phone number.
*   This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
*   If the user doesn't exist, `sign_in_with_otp()` will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set `should_create_user` in `SignInWithPasswordlessCredentials.options` to `false`.
*   If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
*   If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
*   The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls)
    .
*   See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth/overview#redirect-urls-and-wildcards)
     to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
*   Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link, [modify the magic link email template](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates)
     to include `\{\{ .Token \}\}` instead of `\{\{ .ConfirmationURL \}\}`.

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithPasswordCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with emailSign in with SMS OTPSign in with WhatsApp OTP

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_otp(  _10  {  _10  "email": "email@example.com",  _10  "options": {"email_redirect_to": "https://example.com/welcome"},  _10  }  _10  )      `

Response

Notes

* * *

Sign in a user through OAuth
----------------------------

*   This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
*   Supabase supports many different [third-party providers](/docs/guides/auth#configure-third-party-providers)
    .

### Parameters

*   credentialsRequiredSignInWithOAuthCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in using a third-party providerSign in using a third-party provider with redirectSign in with scopes

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_oauth({  _10  "provider": 'github'  _10  })      `

* * *

Sign in a user through SSO
--------------------------

*   Before you can call this method you need to [establish a connection](/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml#managing-saml-20-connections)
     to an identity provider. Use the [CLI commands](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-sso)
     to do this.
*   If you've associated an email domain to the identity provider, you can use the `domain` property to start a sign-in flow.
*   In case you need to use a different way to start the authentication flow with an identity provider, you can use the `provider_id` property. For example:
    *   Mapping specific user email addresses with an identity provider.
    *   Using different hints to identity the identity provider to be used by the user, like a company-specific page, IP address or other tracking information.

### Parameters

*   paramsRequiredSignInWithSSOCredentials
    
    Details
    

Sign in with email domainSign in with provider UUID

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_sso({"domain": "company.com"})      `

Response

Notes

* * *

Sign out a user
---------------

*   In order to use the `sign_out()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
*   By default, `sign_out()` uses the global scope, which signs out all other sessions that the user is logged into as well.
*   Since Supabase Auth uses JWTs for authentication, the access token JWT will be valid until it's expired. When the user signs out, Supabase revokes the refresh token and deletes the JWT from the client-side. This does not revoke the JWT and it will still be valid until it expires.

### Parameters

*   optionsOptionalSignOutOptions
    
    Details
    

Sign out

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.sign_out()      `

* * *

Verify and log in through OTP
-----------------------------

*   The `verify_otp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `email`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change` (`signup` and `magiclink` types are deprecated).
*   The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verify_otp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
*   The `TokenHash` is contained in the [email templates](/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates)
     and can be used to sign in. You may wish to use the hash with Magic Links for the PKCE flow for Server Side Auth. See [this guide](/docs/guides/auth/server-side/email-based-auth-with-pkce-flow-for-ssr)
     for more details.

### Parameters

*   paramsRequiredVerifyOtpParams
    
    Details
    

Verify Signup One-Time Password (OTP)Verify SMS One-Time Password (OTP)Verify Email Auth (Token Hash)

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.verify_otp(  _10  {"email": "email@example.com", "token": "123456", "type": "email"}  _10  )      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a session
------------------

*   This method retrieves the current local session (i.e in memory).
*   The session contains a signed JWT and unencoded session data.
*   Since the unencoded session data is retrieved from the local storage medium, **do not** rely on it as a source of trusted data on the server. It could be tampered with by the sender. If you need verified, trustworthy user data, call [`get_user`](/docs/reference/python/auth-getuser)
     instead.
*   If the session has an expired access token, this method will use the refresh token to get a new session.

Get the session data

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.get_session()      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a new session
----------------------

Returns a new session, regardless of expiry status. Takes in an optional refresh token. If not passed in, then refresh\_session() will attempt to retrieve it from get\_session(). If the current session's refresh token is invalid, an error will be thrown.

*   This method will refresh the session whether the current one is expired or not.

### Parameters

*   refresh\_tokenOptionalstring
    

Refresh session using the current session

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.refresh_session()      `

Response

* * *

Retrieve a user
---------------

*   This method fetches the user object from the database instead of local session.
*   This method is useful for checking if the user is authorized because it validates the user's access token JWT on the server.

### Parameters

*   jwtOptionalstring
    
    Takes in an optional access token JWT. If no JWT is provided, the JWT from the current session is used.
    

Get the logged in user with the current existing sessionGet the logged in user with a custom access token jwt

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.get_user()      `

Response

* * *

Set the session data
--------------------

Sets the session data from the current session. If the current session is expired, setSession will take care of refreshing it to obtain a new session. If the refresh token or access token in the current session is invalid, an error will be thrown.

*   This method sets the session using an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
*   If successful, a `SIGNED_IN` event is emitted.

### Parameters

*   access\_tokenRequiredstring
    
*   refresh\_tokenRequiredstring
    

Refresh the session

`     _10  response = supabase.auth.set_session(access_token, refresh_token)      `

Response

Notes

Auth MFA
--------

This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace.

Currently, we only support time-based one-time password (TOTP) as the 2nd factor. We don't support recovery codes but we allow users to enroll more than 1 TOTP factor, with an upper limit of 10.

Having a 2nd TOTP factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup TOTP factor.

* * *

Enroll a factor
---------------

*   Currently, `totp` is the only supported `factor_type`. The returned `id` should be used to create a challenge.
*   To create a challenge, see [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
    .
*   To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
    .
*   To create and verify a challenge in a single step, see [`mfa.challenge_and_verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challengeandverify)
    .

Enroll a time-based, one-time password (TOTP) factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.enroll({  _10  "factor_type": "totp",  _10  "friendly_name": "your_friendly_name"  _10  })      `

* * *

Create a challenge
------------------

*   An [enrolled factor](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-enroll)
     is required before creating a challenge.
*   To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
    .

Create a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.challenge({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225'  _10  })      `

* * *

Verify a challenge
------------------

*   To verify a challenge, please [create a challenge](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
     first.

Verify a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.verify({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  "challenge_id": '4034ae6f-a8ce-4fb5-8ee5-69a5863a7c15',  _10  "code": '123456'  _10  })      `

* * *

Create and verify a challenge
-----------------------------

*   An [enrolled factor](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-enroll)
     is required before invoking `challengeAndVerify()`.
*   Executes [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-challenge)
     and [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/python/auth-mfa-verify)
     in a single step.

Create and verify a challenge for a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.challenge_and_verify({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  "code": '123456'  _10  })      `

* * *

Unenroll a factor
-----------------

Unenroll a factor

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll({  _10  "factor_id": '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',  _10  })      `

* * *

Get Authenticator Assurance Level
---------------------------------

*   Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is the measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism.
*   In Supabase, having an AAL of `aal1` refers to having the 1st factor of authentication such as an email and password or OAuth sign-in while `aal2` refers to the 2nd factor of authentication such as a time-based, one-time-password (TOTP).
*   If the user has a verified factor, the `next_level` field will return `aal2`, else, it will return `aal1`.

Get the AAL details of a session

`     _10  res = supabase.auth.mfa.get_authenticator_assurance_level()      `

* * *

Invokes a Supabase Edge Function.
---------------------------------

Invoke a Supabase Function.

*   Requires an Authorization header.
*   When you pass in a body to your function, we automatically attach the Content-Type header for `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, `File`, `FormData` and `String`. If it doesn't match any of these types we assume the payload is `json`, serialise it and attach the `Content-Type` header as `application/json`. You can override this behaviour by passing in a `Content-Type` header of your own.

Basic invocationError handlingPassing custom headers

`     _10  response = supabase.functions.invoke(  _10  "hello-world", invoke_options={"body": {"name": "Functions"}}  _10  )      `

* * *

Subscribe to channel
--------------------

*   By default, Broadcast and Presence are enabled for all projects.
*   By default, listening to database changes is disabled for new projects due to database performance and security concerns. You can turn it on by managing Realtime's [replication](/docs/guides/api#realtime-api-overview)
    .
*   You can receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes by setting the table's `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` (e.g., `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`).
*   Row level security is not applied to delete statements. When RLS is enabled and replica identity is set to full, only the primary key is sent to clients.

Listen to broadcast messagesListen to presence syncListen to presence joinListen to presence leaveListen to all database changesListen to a specific tableListen to insertsListen to updatesListen to deletesListen to multiple eventsListen to row level changes

* * *

Unsubscribe from a channel
--------------------------

*   Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.
