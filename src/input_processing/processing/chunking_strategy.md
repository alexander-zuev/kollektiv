 I'll analyze the content structure, propose a chunking strategy, and outline an overall approach for extracting the necessary information.
Content Structure Analysis: The document is a comprehensive API reference for a Python library. It contains:
A main title "Javascript Reference v2.0"
A primary section "Python Client Library" with a description
Multiple main sections (e.g., "Installing", "Initializing", "Fetch data")
Each main section typically contains:
A description
Subsections with "### Parameters"
Code examples
Sometimes additional notes or subsections
Information Extraction Strategy: We need to extract:
Main section titles (H2 level)
Descriptions for each main section
Parameter information
Code examples
Any additional relevant information (notes, subsections)
Optimal Chunking Strategy:
To balance accuracy and complexity, we can use the following approach:
a. Use H2 headers (marked by '----------' under the title) as the primary chunk separators
b. Keep all content under an H2 header together in one chunk, unless it exceeds a token limit
c. If a chunk exceeds the token limit, split it at logical break points:

Before "### Parameters" subsections
Before code blocks (marked by backticks)
Before subsections (marked by '* * *') d. Maintain context by including the H2 header in each chunk e. Use a soft token limit (e.g., 800 tokens) to allow for some flexibility in chunk size
Overall Approach:
a. Preprocess the content:

Split the document into main sections using H2 headers
Identify and mark subsections, parameter blocks, and code examples b. Implement the chunking strategy:
Create initial chunks based on H2 headers
Check token count for each chunk
If a chunk exceeds the soft limit, split it at logical break points
Ensure each sub-chunk maintains context (H2 header) c. Extract and structure information:
For each chunk, extract the H2 title, description, parameters, code examples, and additional information
Organize the extracted information into a structured format (e.g., JSON) d. Post-process the chunks:
Verify that all chunks are within the hard token limit (1000 tokens)
Adjust chunk boundaries if necessary e. Generate metadata:
Create a table of contents based on H2 headers
Add position information to each chunk for maintaining document structure </thought_process>
<solution> Here's a detailed outline of the proposed approach:
Preprocessing:
a. Split the document into main sections using regex to identify H2 headers
b. Within each main section, identify:

Description (text before "### Parameters" or first code block)
Parameter blocks (starting with "### Parameters")
Code examples (text within backticks)
Subsections (separated by '* * *')
Chunking:
a. Initialize each H2 section as a chunk
b. For each chunk:

Calculate token count
If token count > 800:
Split at "### Parameters" if present
Split at code blocks if still too large
Split at subsections if necessary
Ensure each sub-chunk starts with the H2 header for context
Information Extraction:
For each chunk:
a. Extract H2 title
b. Extract description
c. Extract parameters (if present)
d. Extract code examples (if present)
e. Extract additional information (subsections, notes)

Structuring:
Create a JSON object for each chunk:

Raw code
{
  "title": "H2 title",
  "description": "Main description",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "parameter name",
      "type": "parameter type",
      "description": "parameter description"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "code_examples": [
    {
      "title": "example title",
      "code": "code snippet"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "additional_info": [
    {
      "title": "subsection title",
      "content": "subsection content"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "position": chunk_index
}
Post-processing:
a. Verify all chunks are within 1000 token limit
b. Adjust chunk boundaries if necessary (merge small chunks, split large ones)

Metadata Generation:
a. Create a table of contents using H2 headers and their positions
b. Add document-level metadata (total chunks, version, etc.)

This approach provides a balance between accuracy and complexity. It preserves the document structure, maintains context within chunks, and allows for flexible chunking based on content while staying within token limits.
