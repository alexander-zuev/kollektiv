Use the Supabase client libraries to store, index, and query your vector embeddings at scale.\n\nThe toolkit includes:\n\n- A [vector store](/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns) and embeddings support using Postgres and pgvector.\n- A [Python client](/docs/guides/ai/vecs-python-client) for managing unstructured embeddings.\n- An [embedding generation](/docs/guides/ai/quickstarts/generate-text-embeddings) process using open source models directly in Edge Functions.\n- [Database migrations](/docs/guides/ai/examples/headless-vector-search#prepare-your-database) for managing structured embeddings.\n- Integrations with all popular AI providers, such as [OpenAI](/docs/guides/ai/examples/openai), [Hugging Face](/docs/guides/ai/hugging-face), [LangChain](/docs/guides/ai/langchain), and more.\n\nYou can use Supabase to build different types of search features for your app, including:\n\n- [Semantic search](/docs/guides/ai/semantic-search): search by meaning rather than exact keywords\n- [Keyword search](/docs/guides/ai/keyword-search): search by words or phrases\n- [Hybrid search](/docs/guides/ai/hybrid-search): combine semantic search with keyword search\n\n## Examples [\\#](\\#examples)\n\nCheck out all of the AI [templates and examples](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/ai) in our GitHub repository.\n\n[![Headless Vector Search](https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/github-icon-light.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nHeadless Vector Search\\\\\n\\\\\nA toolkit to perform vector similarity search on your knowledge base embeddings.](/docs/guides/ai/examples/headless-vector-search)\n\n[![Image Search with OpenAI CLIP](https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/github-icon-light.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nImage Search with OpenAI CLIP\\\\\n\\\\\nImplement image search with the OpenAI CLIP Model and Supabase Vector.](/docs/guides/ai/examples/image-search-openai-clip)\n\n[![Hugging Face inference](https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/github-icon-light.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nHugging Face inference\\\\\n\\\\\nGenerate image captions using Hugging Face.](/docs/guides/ai/examples/huggingface-image-captioning)\n\n[![OpenAI completions](https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/github-icon-light.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nOpenAI completions\\\\\n\\\\\nGenerate GPT text completions using OpenAI in Edge Functions.](/docs/guides/ai/examples/openai)\n\n[![Building ChatGPT Plugins](https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/github-icon-light.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBuilding ChatGPT Plugins\\\\\n\\\\\nUse Supabase as a Retrieval Store for your ChatGPT plugin.](/docs/guides/ai/examples/building-chatgpt-plugins)\n\n[![Vector search with Next.js and OpenAI](https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/github-icon-light.svg)\\\\\n\\\\\nVector search with Next.js and OpenAI\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn how to build a ChatGPT-style doc search powered by Next.js, OpenAI, and Supabase.](/docs/guides/ai/examples/nextjs-vector-search)\n\n## Integrations [\\#](\\#integrations)\n\n[OpenAI\\\\\n\\\\\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company.
