Your descriptions should explain every detail about the tool, including:\n\n  - What the tool does\n  - When it should be used (and when it shouldn\u2019t)\n  - What each parameter means and how it affects the tool\u2019s behavior\n  - Any important caveats or limitations, such as what information the tool does not return if the tool name is unclear. The more context you can give Claude about your tools, the better it will be at deciding when and how to use them. Aim for at least 3-4 sentences per tool description, more if the tool is complex.\n- **Prioritize descriptions over examples.** While you can include examples of how to use a tool in its description or in the accompanying prompt, this is less important than having a clear and comprehensive explanation of the tool\u2019s purpose and parameters. Only add examples after you\u2019ve fully fleshed out the description.\n\nExample of a good tool description\n\nJSON\n\nCopy\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n  \"description\": \"Retrieves the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.

This is the default value.\n- `any` tells Claude that it must use one of the provided tools, but doesn\u2019t force a particular tool.\n- `tool` allows us to force Claude to always use a particular tool.\n\nThis diagram illustrates how each option works:\n\n![](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/tool_choice.png)\n\nNote that when you have `tool_choice` as `any` or `tool`, we will prefill the assistant message to force a tool to be used. This means that the models will not emit a chain-of-thought `text` content block before `tool_use` content blocks, even if explicitly asked to do so.\n\nOur testing has shown that this should not reduce performance. If you would like to keep chain-of-thought (particularly with Opus) while still requesting that the model use a specific tool, you can use `{\"type\": \"auto\"}` for `tool_choice` (the default) and add explicit instructions in a `user` message. For example: `What's the weather like in London? Use the get_weather tool in your response.`\n\n#### [\u200b](\\#json-output)  JSON output\n\nTools do not necessarily need to be client-side functions \u2014 you can use tools anytime you want the model to return JSON output that follows a provided schema. For example, you might use a `record_summary` tool with a particular schema. See [tool use examples](/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#json-mode) for a full working example.\n\n#### [\u200b](\\#chain-of-thought)  Chain of thought\n\nWhen using tools, Claude will often show its \u201cchain of thought\u201d, i.e. the step-by-step reasoning it uses to break down the problem and decide which tools to use. The Claude 3 Opus model will do this if `tool_choice` is set to `auto` (this is the default value, see [Forcing tool use](/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#forcing-tool-use)), and Sonnet and Haiku can be prompted into doing it.\n\nFor example, given the prompt \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather like in San Francisco right now, and what time is it there?\u201d, Claude might respond with:\n\nJSON\n\nCopy\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": [\\\n    {\\\n      \"type\": \"text\",\\\n      \"text\": \"<thinking>To answer this question, I will: 1.

It\u2019s a fairly cool and overcast day in the city. You may want to bring a light jacket if you\u2019re heading outside. |\n\nThis example demonstrates how Claude can chain together multiple tool calls to answer a question that requires gathering data from different sources. The key steps are:\n\n1. Claude first realizes it needs the user\u2019s location to answer the weather question, so it calls the `get_location` tool.\n2. The user (i.e. the client code) executes the actual `get_location` function and returns the result \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d in a `tool_result` block.\n3. With the location now known, Claude proceeds to call the `get_weather` tool, passing in \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d as the `location` parameter (as well as a guessed `unit` parameter, as `unit` is not a required parameter).\n4. The user again executes the actual `get_weather` function with the provided arguments and returns the weather data in another `tool_result` block.\n5. Finally, Claude incorporates the weather data into a natural language response to the original question.\n\nChain of thought tool use\n\nBy default, Claude 3 Opus is prompted to think before it answers a tool use query to best determine whether a tool is necessary, which tool to use, and the appropriate parameters. Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku are prompted to try to use tools as much as possible and are more likely to call an unnecessary tool or infer missing parameters. To prompt Sonnet or Haiku to better assess the user query before making tool calls, the following prompt can be used:\n\nChain of thought prompt\n\n`Answer the user's request using relevant tools (if they are available). Before calling a tool, do some analysis within \\<thinking>\\</thinking> tags. First, think about which of the provided tools is the relevant tool to answer the user's request. Second, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.     `\n\n",

Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br> \\- Critical Issue: Damages capped at $500, including direct damages.<br> \\- Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.<br> \\- Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.<br>3\\. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br> \\- Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.<br> \\- Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.<br> \\- Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.<br>Professional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains. |\n\n",

The data is retrieved at run time when a query is sent to the model, although the model itself does not necessarily retrieve the data (but can with [tool use](/en/docs/tool-use) and a retrieval function). When generating text, relevant information first must be retrieved from the knowledge base based on the input prompt, and then passed to the model along with the original query. The model uses this information to guide the output it generates. This allows the model to access and utilize information beyond its training data, reducing the reliance on memorization and improving the factual accuracy of the generated text. RAG can be particularly useful for tasks that require up-to-date information, domain-specific knowledge, or explicit citation of sources. However, the effectiveness of RAG depends on the quality and relevance of the external knowledge base and the knowledge that is retrieved at runtime.\n",

Tokens are typically hidden when interacting with language models at the \u201ctext\u201d level but become relevant when examining the exact inputs and outputs of a language model.

Weathering of rocks: Over millions of years, rain, rivers, and streams have eroded rocks containing mineral salts. These salts are carried into the ocean by water runoff.\n2. Volcanic activity: Underwater volcanoes and hydrothermal vents release minerals, including salts, into the ocean water.\n3. Atmospheric deposition: Salt particles from ocean spray can be carried by wind and deposited back into the ocean.\n4. Evaporation: As water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, it leaves behind dissolved salts, increasing the concentration of salt in the remaining water.\n5. Biological processes: Some marine organisms contribute to the ocean's salinity by releasing salt compounds as byproducts of their metabolism.\n\nOver time, these processes have continuously added salts to the ocean, while evaporation removes pure water, leading to the ocean's current salinity levels. It's important to note that the total amount of salt in the ocean remains relatively stable because the input of salts is balanced by the removal of salts through processes like the formation of evaporite deposits.\n\n```\n\n",

The mud, you see, is not your common London clay, but rather the distinctive reddish hue of the iron-rich soil found only in the environs of Hampstead Heath. And yet, the wear on the sole suggests a gait more suited to the cobblestones of Whitechapel than the gentle slopes of the Heath.<br>Now, observe the laces! They are tied with a particular knot favored by those in the medical profession\u2014doubtless a habit acquired during years of tying surgical gowns. But the scuff marks on the toe box tell a different tale: they are consistent with the kicking motion one might employ in the martial arts, specifically Baritsu.<br>We may conclude, then, that our absent shoe owner is a doctor, possibly a surgeon, who resides in Whitechapel but frequents Hampstead Heath\u2014perhaps for a secret Baritsu practice, away from prying eyes.

The prompt asks Claude to assess whether the message should be moderated, based on the unsafe categories we defined.\n\nThe model\u2019s assessment is then parsed to determine if there is a violation. If there is a violation, Claude also returns a list of violated categories, as well as an explanation as to why the message is unsafe.\n\n### [\u200b](\\#evaluate-your-prompt)  Evaluate your prompt\n\nContent moderation is a classification problem. Thus, you can use the same techniques outlined in our [classification cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/classification/guide.ipynb) to determine the accuracy of your content moderation system.\n\nOne additional consideration is that instead of treating content moderation as a binary classification problem, you may instead create multiple categories to represent various risk levels. Creating multiple risk levels allows you to adjust the aggressiveness of your moderation. For example, you might want to automatically block user queries that are deemed high risk, while users with many medium risk queries are flagged for human review.\n\nCopy\n\n```python\nimport anthropic\nimport json\n\n# Initialize the Anthropic client\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic()\n\ndef assess_risk_level(message, unsafe_categories):\n    # Convert the list of unsafe categories into a string, with each category on a new line\n    unsafe_category_str = '\\n'.join(unsafe_categories)\n\n    # Construct the prompt for Claude, including the message, unsafe categories, and risk level definitions\n    assessment_prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Assess the risk level of the following message warrants moderation,\n    based on the unsafe categories listed below.\n\nMessage:\n<message>{message}</message>\n\nUnsafe Categories:\n<categories>\n{unsafe_category_str}\n</categories>\n\nAssign a risk level based on your confidence that the user's message should be moderated\nbased on the defined unsafe categories:\n\n0 - No risk\n1 - Low risk\n2 - Medium risk\n3 - High risk\n\nRespond with ONLY a JSON object, using the format below:\n{{\n  \"risk_level\": <Numerical field denoting the risk level>,\n  \"categories\": [Comma-separated list of violated categories],\n  \"explanation\": <Optional. Only include if risk level is greater than 0>\n}}\"\"\"\n\n    # Send the request to Claude for risk assessment\n    response = client.messages.create(\n        model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\",  # Using the Haiku model for lower costs\n        max_tokens=200,\n        temperature=0,   # Use 0 temperature for increased consistency\n        messages=[\\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": assessment_prompt}\\\n        ]\n    )\n\n    # Parse the JSON response from Claude\n    assessment = json.loads(response.content[0].text)\n\n    # Extract the risk level, violated categories, and explanation from the assessment\n    risk_level = assessment[\"risk_level\"]\n    violated_categories = assessment[\"categories\"]\n    explanation = assessment.get(\"explanation\")\n\n    return risk_level, violated_categories, explanation\n\n# Process each comment and print the results\nfor comment in user_comments:\n    print(f\"\\nComment: {comment}\")\n    risk_level, violated_categories, explanation = assess_risk_level(comment, unsafe_categories)\n\n    print(f\"Risk Level: {risk_level}\")\n    if violated_categories:\n        print(f\"Violated Categories: {', '.join(violated_categories)}\")\n    if explanation:\n        print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n\n",

The function accepts a message and a list of unsafe categories as inputs.\n\nWithin the function, a prompt is generated for Claude, including the message to be assessed, the unsafe categories, and specific instructions for evaluating the risk level. The prompt instructs Claude to respond with a JSON object that includes the risk level, the violated categories, and an optional explanation.\n\nThis approach enables flexible content moderation by assigning risk levels. It can be seamlessly integrated into a larger system to automate content filtering or flag comments for human review based on their assessed risk level. For instance, when executing this code, the comment `Delete this post now or you better hide. I am coming after you and your family.` is identified as high risk due to its dangerous threat. Conversely, the comment `Stay away from the 5G cellphones!! They are using 5G to control you.` is categorized as medium risk.\n",

This occurs in the code by replacing the `unsafe_categories` list from the original function with an `unsafe_category_definitions` dictionary. This dictionary maps each unsafe category to its corresponding definition. Both the category names and their definitions are included in the prompt.\n\nNotably, the definition for the `Specialized Advice` category now specifies the types of financial advice that should be prohibited. As a result, the comment `It's a great time to invest in gold!`, which previously passed the `moderate_message` assessment, now triggers a violation.\n\n### [\u200b](\\#consider-batch-processing)  Consider batch processing\n\nTo reduce costs in situations where real-time moderation isn\u2019t necessary, consider moderating messages in batches.

Each message in the response is identified by its id, which corresponds to the message\u2019s position in the input list.\nKeep in mind that finding the optimal batch size for your specific needs may require some experimentation. While larger batch sizes can lower costs, they might also lead to a slight decrease in quality. Additionally, you may need to increase the `max_tokens` parameter in the Claude API call to accommodate longer responses.

Revenue Growth:<br>Our Q2 revenue reached $15.2M, a 22% YoY increase. This growth is primarily driven by a 30% expansion in our enterprise client base. However, our SMB segment saw a slight decline of 5%, which we aim to address through targeted marketing initiatives in Q3.<br>2\\. Profit Margins:<br>Gross margin improved to 72% (up 3% from Q1) due to infrastructure optimizations. EBITDA margin, however, dipped to 18% (down 2%) as we invested heavily in R&D for our upcoming AI-driven features.<br>3\\. Cash Flow:<br>Operating cash flow remains strong at $4.1M. Our cash reserves stand at $28M, providing a 15-month runway at current burn rate. We did see a 20% increase in customer acquisition costs, which we\u2019re addressing through more efficient sales strategies.<br>In summary, AcmeCorp\u2019s core financials remain robust. We\u2019re balancing growth investments with prudent cash management. Our focus for Q3 will be revitalizing SMB growth and optimizing sales efficiency.<br>Thank you for your continued trust.<br>Sincerely,<br>CFO, AcmeCorp | Q2 Financial Report for AcmeCorp Investors</output><br>Revenue Growth:<br>\\- Q2 revenue: $15.2M (22% YoY \u2191)<br>\\- Enterprise clients: 30% \u2191<br>\\- SMB segment: 5% \u2193<br> Action: Targeted Q3 marketing<br>Profit Margins:<br>\\- Gross margin: 72% (3% \u2191 from Q1)<br> Reason: Infrastructure optimizations<br>\\- EBITDA margin: 18% (2% \u2193)<br> Reason: R&D investment in AI features<br>Cash Flow:<br>\\- Operating cash flow: $4.1M (strong)<br>\\- Cash reserves: $28M (15-month runway)<br>\\- Customer acquisition cost: 20% \u2191<br> Action: Optimize sales strategies<br>Outlook:<br>\\- Core financials: Robust<br>\\- Q3 focus: Revitalize SMB, optimize sales<br>Management remains committed to balancing growth investments with financial discipline. |\n\n",

The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere $500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create.<br>In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest.

Which option do you recommend? |\n| Assistant | Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here\u2019s why:<br>1\\. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years).<br>2\\. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there\u2019s a downturn close to when they need the funds.<br>3\\. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there\u2019s less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.<br>While the stock\u2019s historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results.

The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Think step-by-step. |\n| Assistant | To determine the best investment option for our client, I\u2019ll consider several factors step-by-step:<br><thinking><br>1\\. Understand the client\u2019s goal and timeline:<br> \\- Goal: Down payment for a house<br> \\- Timeline: 5 years<br> \\- Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.<br>2\\. Analyze Option A (Stock):<br> \\- Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)<br> \\- Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)<br> \\- Calculate potential 5-year return:<br> \\- Best case (12% annually): $10,000 \\* (1.12)^5 \u2248 $17,623.42<br> \\- Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = $5,000<br>3\\. Analyze Option B (Bond):<br> \\- Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)<br> \\- Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance<br> \\- Calculate 5-year return:<br> \\- Guaranteed: $10,000 \\* (1.06)^5 \u2248 $13,382.25<br>4\\. Consider risk tolerance:<br> \\- Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)<br> \\- Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns<br> \\- Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance<br>5\\. Historical perspective:<br> \\- Stock\u2019s 12% is historical, not guaranteed<br> \\- In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:<br> \\- 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S&P 500 up ~82%<br> \\- 2007-2011 (during crisis): S&P 500 down ~2%<br> \\- Conclusion: Past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results, especially short-term<br>6\\.

While the stock\u2019s historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you\u2019ll have $13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment.

To determine the readiness of your solution, evaluate the chatbot performance using a systematic process combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Creating a [strong empirical evaluation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/develop-tests#building-evals-and-test-cases) based on your defined success criteria will allow you to optimize your prompts.\n\nThe [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) now features an Evaluation tool that allows you to test your prompts under various scenarios.\n\n### [\u200b](\\#improve-performance)  Improve performance\n\nIn complex scenarios, it may be helpful to consider additional strategies to improve performance beyond standard [prompt engineering techniques](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) & [guardrail implementation strategies](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/reduce-hallucinations). Here are some common scenarios:\n\n#### [\u200b](\\#reduce-long-context-latency-with-rag)  Reduce long context latency with RAG\n\nWhen dealing with large amounts of static and dynamic context, including all information in the prompt can lead to high costs, slower response times, and reaching context window limits. In this scenario, implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can significantly improve performance and efficiency.\n\nBy using [embedding models like Voyage](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/embeddings) to convert information into vector representations, you can create a more scalable and responsive system. This approach allows for dynamic retrieval of relevant information based on the current query, rather than including all possible context in every prompt.\n\nImplementing RAG for support use cases [RAG recipe](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/82675c124e1344639b2a875aa9d3ae854709cd83/skills/classification/guide.ipynb) has been shown to increase accuracy, reduce response times, and reduce API costs in systems with extensive context requirements.\n\n#### [\u200b](\\#integrate-real-time-data-with-tool-use)  Integrate real-time data with tool use\n\nWhen dealing with queries that require real-time information, such as account balances or policy details, embedding-based RAG approaches are not sufficient. Instead, you can leverage tool use to significantly enhance your chatbot\u2019s ability to provide accurate, real-time responses. For example, you can use tool use to look up customer information, retrieve order details, and cancel orders on behalf of the customer.\n\nThis approach, [outlined in our tool use: customer service agent recipe](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/tool_use/customer_service_agent.ipynb), allows you to seamlessly integrate live data into your Claude\u2019s responses and provide a more personalized and efficient customer experience.\n\n#### [\u200b](\\#strengthen-input-and-output-guardrails)  Strengthen input and output guardrails\n\nWhen deploying a chatbot, especially in customer service scenarios, it\u2019s crucial to prevent risks associated with misuse, out-of-scope queries, and inappropriate responses. While Claude is inherently resilient to such scenarios, here are additional steps to strengthen your chatbot guardrails:\n\n- [Reduce hallucination](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/reduce-hallucinations): Implement fact-checking mechanisms and [citations](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/citations/guide.ipynb) to ground responses in provided information.\n- Cross-check information: Verify that the agent\u2019s responses align with your company\u2019s policies and known facts.\n- Avoid contractual commitments: Ensure the agent doesn\u2019t make promises or enter into agreements it\u2019s not authorized to make.\n- [Mitigate jailbreaks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/mitigate-jailbreaks): Use methods like harmlessness screens and input validation to prevent users from exploiting model vulnerabilities, aiming to generate inappropriate content.\n- Avoid mentioning competitors: Implement a competitor mention filter to maintain brand focus and not mention any competitor\u2019s products or services.\n- [Keep Claude in character](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/keep-claude-in-character): Prevent Claude from changing their style of context, even during long, complex interactions.\n- Remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Unless explicitly required and authorized, strip out any PII from responses.\n\n#### [\u200b](\\#reduce-perceived-response-time-with-streaming)  Reduce perceived response time with streaming\n\nWhen dealing with potentially lengthy responses, implementing streaming can significantly improve user engagement and satisfaction. In this scenario, users receive the answer progressively instead of waiting for the entire response to be generated.\n\nHere is how to implement streaming:\n\n1. Use the [Anthropic Streaming API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming) to support streaming responses.\n2. Set up your frontend to handle incoming chunks of text.\n3. Display each chunk as it arrives, simulating real-time typing.\n4. Implement a mechanism to save the full response, allowing users to view it if they navigate away and return.\n\nIn some cases, streaming enables the use of more advanced models with higher base latencies, as the progressive display mitigates the impact of longer processing times.\n\n#### [\u200b](\\#scale-your-chatbot)  Scale your Chatbot\n\nAs the complexity of your Chatbot grows, your application architecture can evolve to match. Before you add further layers to your architecture, consider the following less exhaustive options:\n\n- Ensure that you are making the most out of your prompts and optimizing through prompt engineering. Use our [prompt engineering guides](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) to write the most effective prompts.\n- Add additional [tools](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use) to the prompt (which can include [prompt chains](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts)) and see if you can achieve the functionality required.\n\nIf your Chatbot handles incredibly varied tasks, you may want to consider adding a [separate intent classifier](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/classification/guide.ipynb) to route the initial customer query. For the existing application, this would involve creating a decision tree that would route customer queries through the classifier and then to specialized conversations (with their own set of tools and system prompts). Note, this method requires an additional call to Claude that can increase latency.\n\n### [\u200b](\\#integrate-claude-into-your-support-workflow)  Integrate Claude into your support workflow\n\nWhile our examples have focused on Python functions callable within a Streamlit environment, deploying Claude for real-time support chatbot requires an API service.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can approach this:\n\n1. Create an API wrapper: Develop a simple API wrapper around your classification function. For example, you can use Flask API or Fast API to wrap your code into a HTTP Service. Your HTTP service could accept the user input and return the Assistant response in its entirety. Thus, your service could have the following characteristics:\n   - Server-Sent Events (SSE): SSE allows for real-time streaming of responses from the server to the client. This is crucial for providing a smooth, interactive experience when working with LLMs.\n   - Caching: Implementing caching can significantly improve response times and reduce unnecessary API calls.\n   - Context retention: Maintaining context when a user navigates away and returns is important for continuity in conversations.\n2. Build a web interface: Implement a user-friendly web UI for interacting with the Claude-powered agent.\n\n\n[**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) cookbook** \\\\\n\\\\\nVisit our RAG cookbook recipe for more example code and detailed guidance.](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/retrieval_augmented_generation/guide.ipynb) [**Citations cookbook** \\\\\n\\\\\nExplore our Citations cookbook recipe for how to ensure accuracy and explainability of information.](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/citations/guide.ipynb)\n\n[Ticket routing](/en/docs/about-claude/use-case-guides/ticket-routing) [Content moderation](/en/docs/about-claude/use-case-guides/content-moderation)\n\nOn this page\n\n- [Before building with Claude](#before-building-with-claude)\n- [Decide whether to use Claude for support chat](#decide-whether-to-use-claude-for-support-chat)\n- [Define your ideal chat interaction](#define-your-ideal-chat-interaction)\n- [Break the interaction into unique tasks](#break-the-interaction-into-unique-tasks)\n- [Establish success criteria](#establish-success-criteria)\n- [How to implement Claude as a customer service agent](#how-to-implement-claude-as-a-customer-service-agent)\n- [Choose the right Claude model](#choose-the-right-claude-model)\n- [Build a strong prompt](#build-a-strong-prompt)\n- [Add dynamic and agentic capabilities with tool use](#add-dynamic-and-agentic-capabilities-with-tool-use)\n- [Deploy your prompts](#deploy-your-prompts)\n- [Build your user interface](#build-your-user-interface)\n- [Evaluate your prompts](#evaluate-your-prompts)\n- [Improve performance](#improve-performance)\n- [Reduce long context latency with RAG](#reduce-long-context-latency-with-rag)\n- [Integrate real-time data with tool use](#integrate-real-time-data-with-tool-use)\n- [Strengthen input and output guardrails](#strengthen-input-and-output-guardrails)\n- [Reduce perceived response time with streaming](#reduce-perceived-response-time-with-streaming)\n- [Scale your Chatbot](#scale-your-chatbot)\n- [Integrate Claude into your support workflow](#integrate-claude-into-your-support-workflow)\n",

Optimize prompt and output length\n\nMinimize the number of tokens in both your input prompt and the expected output, while still maintaining high performance.

Avoid unnecessary details or redundant information, while keeping in mind that [claude lacks context](/en/docs/be-clear-direct) on your use case and may not make the intended leaps of logic if instructions are unclear.\n",

This agreement was sourced from a publicly available sublease agreement from the [sec.gov website](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045425/000119312507044370/dex1032.htm).\n\nWe use the pypdf library to extract the contents of the pdf and convert it to text.

You can change the details of the prompt to guide Claude to be more or less verbose, include more or less technical terminology, or provide a higher or lower level summary of the context at hand.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to create a prompt that ensures the generated summaries follow a consistent structure when analyzing sublease agreements:\n\nCopy\n\n```python\nimport anthropic\n\n# Initialize the Anthropic client\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic()\n\ndef summarize_document(text, details_to_extract, model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\", max_tokens=1000):\n\n    # Format the details to extract to be placed within the prompt's context\n    details_to_extract_str = '\\n'.join(details_to_extract)\n\n    # Prompt the model to summarize the sublease agreement\n    prompt = f\"\"\"Summarize the following sublease agreement. Focus on these key aspects:\n\n    {details_to_extract_str}\n\n    Provide the summary in bullet points nested within the XML header for each section. For example:\n\n    <parties involved>\n    - Sublessor: [Name]\n    // Add more details as needed\n    </parties involved>\n\n    If any information is not explicitly stated in the document, note it as \"Not specified\". Do not preamble.\n\n    Sublease agreement text:\n    {text}\n    \"\"\"\n\n    response = client.messages.create(\n        model=model,\n        max_tokens=max_tokens,\n        system=\"You are a legal analyst specializing in real estate law, known for highly accurate and detailed summaries of sublease agreements.\",\n        messages=[\\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt},\\\n            {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the summary of the sublease agreement: <summary>\"}\\\n        ],\n        stop_sequences=[\"</summary>\"]\n    )\n\n    return response.content[0].text\n\nsublease_summary = summarize_document(document_text, details_to_extract)\nprint(sublease_summary)\n\n```\n\n"

The individual summaries are then combined, and a final summary is created from these chunk summaries.\n\nNote that the `summarize_long_document` function isn\u2019t strictly necessary for our example pdf, as the entire document fits within Claude\u2019s context window. However, it becomes essential for documents exceeding Claude\u2019s context window or when summarizing multiple related documents together. Regardless, this meta-summarization technique often captures additional important details in the final summary that were missed in the earlier single-summary approach.\n\n### [\u200b](\\#use-summary-indexed-documents-to-explore-a-large-collection-of-documents)  Use summary indexed documents to explore a large collection of documents\n\nSearching a collection of documents with an LLM usually involves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, in scenarios involving large documents or when precise information retrieval is crucial, a basic RAG approach may be insufficient. Summary indexed documents is an advanced RAG approach that provides a more efficient way of ranking documents for retrieval, using less context than traditional RAG methods. In this approach, you first use Claude to generate a concise summary for each document in your corpus, and then use Clade to rank the relevance of each summary to the query being asked. For further details on this approach, including a code-based example, check out the summary indexed documents section in the [summarization cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/summarization/guide.ipynb).\n\n### [\u200b](\\#fine-tune-claude-to-learn-from-your-dataset)  Fine-tune Claude to learn from your dataset\n\nAnother advanced technique to improve Claude\u2019s ability to generate summaries is fine-tuning. Fine-tuning involves training Claude on a custom dataset that specifically aligns with your legal summarization needs, ensuring that Claude adapts to your use case. Here\u2019s an overview on how to perform fine-tuning:\n\n1. **Identify errors:** Start by collecting instances where Claude\u2019s summaries fall short - this could include missing critical legal details, misunderstanding context, or using inappropriate legal terminology.\n\n2. **Curate a dataset:** Once you\u2019ve identified these issues, compile a dataset of these problematic examples. This dataset should include the original legal documents alongside your corrected summaries, ensuring that Claude learns the desired behavior.\n\n3. **Perform fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning involves retraining the model on your curated dataset to adjust its weights and parameters. This retraining helps Claude better understand the specific requirements of your legal domain, improving its ability to summarize documents according to your standards.\n\n4. **Iterative improvement:** Fine-tuning is not a one-time process. As Claude continues to generate summaries, you can iteratively add new examples where it has underperformed, further refining its capabilities. Over time, this continuous feedback loop will result in a model that is highly specialized for your legal summarization tasks.\n\n\nFine-tuning is currently only available via Amazon Bedrock. Additional details are available in the [AWS launch blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/fine-tune-anthropics-claude-3-haiku-in-amazon-bedrock-to-boost-model-accuracy-and-quality/).\n\n[**Summarization cookbook** \\\\\n\\\\\nView a fully implemented code-based example of how to use Claude to summarize contracts.](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/summarization/guide.ipynb) [**Citations cookbook** \\\\\n\\\\\nExplore our Citations cookbook recipe for guidance on how to ensure accuracy and explainability of information.](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/citations/guide.ipynb)\n\n[Content moderation](/en/docs/about-claude/use-case-guides/content-moderation) [Models](/en/docs/about-claude/models)\n\nOn this page\n\n- [Before building with Claude](#before-building-with-claude)\n- [Decide whether to use Claude for legal summarization](#decide-whether-to-use-claude-for-legal-summarization)\n- [Determine the details you want the summarization to extract](#determine-the-details-you-want-the-summarization-to-extract)\n- [Establish success criteria](#establish-success-criteria)\n- [How to summarize legal documents using Claude](#how-to-summarize-legal-documents-using-claude)\n- [Select the right Claude model](#select-the-right-claude-model)\n- [Transform documents into a format that Claude can process](#transform-documents-into-a-format-that-claude-can-process)\n- [Build a strong prompt](#build-a-strong-prompt)\n- [Evaluate your prompt](#evaluate-your-prompt)\n- [Deploy your prompt](#deploy-your-prompt)\n- [Improve performance](#improve-performance)\n- [Perform meta-summarization to summarize long documents](#perform-meta-summarization-to-summarize-long-documents)\n- [Use summary indexed documents to explore a large collection of documents](#use-summary-indexed-documents-to-explore-a-large-collection-of-documents)\n- [Fine-tune Claude to learn from your dataset](#fine-tune-claude-to-learn-from-your-dataset)\n",

      "text": "| Assistant<br>{{STRATEGY\\_DOC}} | \\# Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product<br>\\## Executive Summary<br>The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br>\\## Detailed Analysis<br>\\### 1\\. Scalability: B+<br>Strengths:<br>\\- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br>\\- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\\- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br>\\- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br>\\### 2\\. Security: B-<br>Strengths:<br>\\- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br>\\- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\\- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br>\\- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br>\\- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br>\\### 3\\. Cost-effectiveness: B<br>Strengths:<br>\\- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br>\\- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\\- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br>\\- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br>\\- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br>\\## Recommendations<br>1\\. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br>2\\. **Security Hardening**:<br> a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br> b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br> c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br>3\\. **Cost Optimization**:<br> a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br> b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br> c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br>4\\. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br> a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br> b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br> c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br>With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |\n",
