The more context you can give Claude about your tools, the better it will be at deciding when and how to use them. Aim for at least 3-4 sentences per tool description, more if the tool is complex.\n- **Prioritize descriptions over examples.** While you can include examples of how to use a tool in its description or in the accompanying prompt, this is less important than having a clear and comprehensive explanation of the tool\u2019s purpose and parameters. Only add examples after you\u2019ve fully fleshed out the description.\n\nExample of a good tool description\n\nJSON\n\nCopy\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_stock_price\",\n  \"description\": \"Retrieves the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.

This is the default value.\n- `any` tells Claude that it must use one of the provided tools, but doesn\u2019t force a particular tool.\n- `tool` allows us to force Claude to always use a particular tool.\n\nThis diagram illustrates how each option works:\n\n![](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/tool_choice.png)\n\nNote that when you have `tool_choice` as `any` or `tool`, we will prefill the assistant message to force a tool to be used. This means that the models will not emit a chain-of-thought `text` content block before `tool_use` content blocks, even if explicitly asked to do so.\n\nOur testing has shown that this should not reduce performance. If you would like to keep chain-of-thought (particularly with Opus) while still requesting that the model use a specific tool, you can use `{\"type\": \"auto\"}` for `tool_choice` (the default) and add explicit instructions in a `user` message.

The Claude 3 Opus model will do this if `tool_choice` is set to `auto` (this is the default value, see [Forcing tool use](/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#forcing-tool-use)), and Sonnet and Haiku can be prompted into doing it.\n\nFor example, given the prompt \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather like in San Francisco right now, and what time is it there?\u201d, Claude might respond with:\n\nJSON\n\nCopy\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": [\\\n    {\\\n      \"type\": \"text\",\\\n      \"text\": \"<thinking>To answer this question, I will: 1.

Your code should treat the chain of thought like any other assistant-generated text, and not rely on the presence or specific formatting of the `<thinking>` tags.\n",

Your best bet during development is to try the request again with more-detailed `description` values in your tool definitions.\n\nHowever, you can also continue the conversation forward with a `tool_result` that indicates the error, and Claude will try to use the tool again with the missing information filled in:\n\nJSON\n\nCopy\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": [\\\n    {\\\n      \"type\": \"tool_result\",\\\n      \"tool_use_id\": \"toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9\",\\\n      \"content\": \"Error: Missing required 'location' parameter\",\\\n      \"is_error\": true\\\n    }\\\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\nIf a tool request is invalid or missing parameters, Claude will retry 2-3 times with corrections before apologizing to the user.\n\n<search\\_quality\\_reflection> tags\n\nTo prevent Claude from reflecting on search quality with <search\\_quality\\_reflection> tags, add \u201cDo not reflect on the quality of the returned search results in your response\u201d to your prompt.\n\n* * *\n",

Here\u2019s an example with both a `get_weather` and a `get_time` tool, along with a user query that asks for both.\n\nShell\n\nPython\n\nCopy\n\n```bash\ncurl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \\\n     --header \"x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" \\\n     --header \"anthropic-version: 2023-06-01\" \\\n     --header \"content-type: application/json\" \\\n     --data \\\n'{\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\n    \"max_tokens\": 1024,\n    \"tools\": [{\\\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\\\n        \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\\\n        \"input_schema\": {\\\n            \"type\": \"object\",\\\n            \"properties\": {\\\n                \"location\": {\\\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\\\n                    \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\\\n                },\\\n                \"unit\": {\\\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\\\n                    \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"],\\\n                    \"description\": \"The unit of temperature, either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'\"\\\n                }\\\n            },\\\n            \"required\": [\"location\"]\\\n        }\\\n    },\\\n    {\\\n        \"name\": \"get_time\",\\\n        \"description\": \"Get the current time in a given time zone\",\\\n        \"input_schema\": {\\\n            \"type\": \"object\",\\\n            \"properties\": {\\\n                \"timezone\": {\\\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\\\n                    \"description\": \"The IANA time zone name, e.g. America/Los_Angeles\"\\\n                }\\\n            },\\\n            \"required\": [\"timezone\"]\\\n        }\\\n    }],\n    \"messages\": [{\\\n        \"role\": \"user\",\\\n        \"content\": \"What is the weather like right now in New York? Also what time is it there?\"\\\n    }]\n}'\n\n```\n\nIn this case, Claude will most likely try to use two separate tools, one at a time \u2014 `get_weather` and then `get_time` \u2014 in order to fully answer the user\u2019s question. However, it will also occasionally output two `tool_use` blocks at once, particularly if they are not dependent on each other. You would need to execute each tool and return their results in separate `tool_result` blocks within a single `user` message.\n\nMissing information\n\nIf the user\u2019s prompt doesn\u2019t include enough information to fill all the required parameters for a tool, Claude 3 Opus is much more likely to recognize that a parameter is missing and ask for it. Claude 3 Sonnet may ask, especially when prompted to think before outputting a tool request. But it may also do its best to infer a reasonable value.\n\nFor example, using the `get_weather` tool above, if you ask Claude \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather?\u201d without specifying a location, Claude, particularly Claude 3 Sonnet, may make a guess about tools inputs:\n\nJSON\n\nCopy\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n  \"id\": \"toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9\",\n  \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n  \"input\": {\"location\": \"New York, NY\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}\n}\n\n",

If Claude 3 Opus doesn\u2019t have enough context to fill in the required parameters, it is far more likely respond with a clarifying question instead of making a tool call.\n\nSequential tools\n\nSome tasks may require calling multiple tools in sequence, using the output of one tool as the input to another. In such a case, Claude will call one tool at a time. If prompted to call the tools all at once, Claude is likely to guess parameters for tools further downstream if they are dependent on tool results for tools further upstream.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of using a `get_location` tool to get the user\u2019s location, then passing that location to the `get_weather` tool:\n\nShell\n\nPython\n\nCopy\n\n```bash\ncurl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \\\n     --header \"x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" \\\n     --header \"anthropic-version: 2023-06-01\" \\\n     --header \"content-type: application/json\" \\\n     --data \\\n'{\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\n    \"max_tokens\": 1024,\n    \"tools\": [\\\n        {\\\n            \"name\": \"get_location\",\\\n            \"description\": \"Get the current user location based on their IP address.

After you return the location in a `tool_result`, Claude would then call `get_weather` with that location to get the final answer.\n\nThe full conversation might look like:\n\n| Role | Content |\n| --- | --- |\n| User | What\u2019s the weather like where I am? |\n| Assistant | <thinking>To answer this, I first need to determine the user\u2019s location using the get\\_location tool.

      "text": "This example demonstrates how Claude can chain together multiple tool calls to answer a question that requires gathering data from different sources. The key steps are:\n\n1. Claude first realizes it needs the user\u2019s location to answer the weather question, so it calls the `get_location` tool.\n2. The user (i.e. the client code) executes the actual `get_location` function and returns the result \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d in a `tool_result` block.\n3. With the location now known, Claude proceeds to call the `get_weather` tool, passing in \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d as the `location` parameter (as well as a guessed `unit` parameter, as `unit` is not a required parameter).\n4. The user again executes the actual `get_weather` function with the provided arguments and returns the weather data in another `tool_result` block.\n5. Finally, Claude incorporates the weather data into a natural language response to the original question.\n\nChain of thought tool use\n\nBy default, Claude 3 Opus is prompted to think before it answers a tool use query to best determine whether a tool is necessary, which tool to use, and the appropriate parameters. Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku are prompted to try to use tools as much as possible and are more likely to call an unnecessary tool or infer missing parameters. To prompt Sonnet or Haiku to better assess the user query before making tool calls, the following prompt can be used:\n\nChain of thought prompt\n\n`Answer the user's request using relevant tools (if they are available). Before calling a tool, do some analysis within \\<thinking>\\</thinking> tags. First, think about which of the provided tools is the relevant tool to answer the user's request. Second, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool call. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the function (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.     `\n\nJSON mode\n\nYou can use tools to get Claude produce JSON output that follows a schema, even if you don\u2019t have any intention of running that output through a tool or function.\n\nWhen using tools in this way:\n\n- You usually want to provide a **single** tool\n- You should set `tool_choice` (see [Forcing tool use](/en/docs/tool-use#forcing-tool-use)) to instruct the model to explicitly use that tool\n- Remember that the model will pass the `input` to the tool, so the name of the tool and description should be from the model\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe following uses a `record_summary` tool to describe an image following a particular format.\n\nShell\n\nPython\n\nCopy\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nIMAGE_URL=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg\"\nIMAGE_MEDIA_TYPE=\"image/jpeg\"\nIMAGE_BASE64=$(curl \"$IMAGE_URL\" | base64)\n\ncurl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \\\n     --header \"content-type: application/json\" \\\n     --header \"x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" \\\n     --header \"anthropic-version: 2023-06-01\" \\\n     --data \\\n'{\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240229\",\n    \"max_tokens\": 1024,\n    \"tools\": [{\\\n        \"name\": \"record_summary\",\\\n        \"description\": \"Record summary of an image using well-structured JSON.\",\\\n        \"input_schema\": {\\\n            \"type\": \"object\",\\\n            \"properties\": {\\\n                \"key_colors\": {\\\n                    \"type\": \"array\",\\\n                    \"items\": {\\\n                        \"type\": \"object\",\\\n                        \"properties\": {\\\n                            \"r\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"red value [0.0, 1.0]\" },\\\n                            \"g\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"green value [0.0, 1.0]\" },\\\n                            \"b\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"blue value [0.0, 1.0]\" },\\\n                            \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Human-readable color name in snake_case, e.g. \\\"olive_green\\\" or \\\"turquoise\\\"\" }\\\n                        },\\\n                        \"required\": [ \"r\", \"g\", \"b\", \"name\" ]\\\n                    },\\\n                    \"description\": \"Key colors in the image.

The data is retrieved at run time when a query is sent to the model, although the model itself does not necessarily retrieve the data (but can with [tool use](/en/docs/tool-use) and a retrieval function). When generating text, relevant information first must be retrieved from the knowledge base based on the input prompt, and then passed to the model along with the original query. The model uses this information to guide the output it generates. This allows the model to access and utilize information beyond its training data, reducing the reliance on memorization and improving the factual accuracy of the generated text. RAG can be particularly useful for tasks that require up-to-date information, domain-specific knowledge, or explicit citation of sources. However, the effectiveness of RAG depends on the quality and relevance of the external knowledge base and the knowledge that is retrieved at runtime.\n",

As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working.

As you\u2019re learning to make the most of Claude, we recommend that you start the development process in the Workbench, a web-based interface to Claude.\n\nLog into the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com) and click **Workbench**.\n\nIn the middle section, under User, let\u2019s ask Claude a question.\n\nUser\n\nCopy\n\n```Unset\nWhy is the ocean salty?\n\n```\n\nClick **Run**. On the right side, you\u2019ll see output like\n\nResponse\n\nCopy\n\n```Unset\nThe ocean is salty due to several factors:\n\n1. Weathering of rocks: Over millions of years, rain, rivers, and streams have eroded rocks containing mineral salts. These salts are carried into the ocean by water runoff.\n2. Volcanic activity: Underwater volcanoes and hydrothermal vents release minerals, including salts, into the ocean water.\n3. Atmospheric deposition: Salt particles from ocean spray can be carried by wind and deposited back into the ocean.\n4. Evaporation: As water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, it leaves behind dissolved salts, increasing the concentration of salt in the remaining water.\n5. Biological processes: Some marine organisms contribute to the ocean's salinity by releasing salt compounds as byproducts of their metabolism.\n\nOver time, these processes have continuously added salts to the ocean, while evaporation removes pure water, leading to the ocean's current salinity levels. It's important to note that the total amount of salt in the ocean remains relatively stable because the input of salts is balanced by the removal of salts through processes like the formation of evaporite deposits.\n\n```\n\nThis is a good answer, but let\u2019s say we wanted to control the exact type of answer Claude gives. For example, only allowing Claude to respond to questions with poems. We can control the format, tone, and personality of the response by adding a System Prompt.\n\nSystem prompt\n\nCopy\n\n```Unset\nYou are a world-class poet. Respond only with short poems.\n\n```\n\nClick **Run** again.\n\nResponse\n\nCopy\n\n```Unset\nThe ocean's salty brine,\nA tale of time and elements combined.\nRocks and rain, a slow erosion,\nMinerals carried in solution.\nEons pass, the salt remains,\nIn the vast, eternal watery domain.\n\n```\n\nSee how Claude\u2019s response has changed? LLMs respond well to clear and direct instructions. You can put the role instructions in either the system prompt or the user message. We recommend testing to see which way yields the best results for your use case.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve tweaked the inputs such that you\u2019re pleased with the output\u2013-and have a good sense how to use Claude\u2013-convert your Workbench into an integration.\n\nClick **Get Code** to copy the generated code representing your Workbench session.\n",

This approach significantly reduces processing time and costs for repetitive tasks or prompts with consistent elements.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to implement Prompt Caching with the Messages API using a `cache_control` block:\n\nShell\n\nPython\n\nCopy\n\n```bash\ncurl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \\\n  -H \"content-type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"anthropic-version: 2023-06-01\" \\\n  -H \"anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\n    \"max_tokens\": 1024,\n    \"system\": [\\\n      {\\\n        \"type\": \"text\",\\\n        \"text\": \"You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing literary works. Your goal is to provide insightful commentary on themes, characters, and writing style.\\n\"\\\n      },\\\n      {\\\n        \"type\": \"text\",\\\n        \"text\": \"<the entire contents of Pride and Prejudice>\",\\\n        \"cache_control\": {\"type\": \"ephemeral\"}\\\n      }\\\n    ],\n    \"messages\": [\\\n      {\\\n        \"role\": \"user\",\\\n        \"content\": \"Analyze the major themes in Pride and Prejudice.\"\\\n      }\\\n    ]\n  }'\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the entire text of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d is cached using the `cache_control` parameter. This enables reuse of this large text across multiple API calls without reprocessing it each time. Changing only the user message allows you to ask various questions about the book while utilizing the cached content, leading to faster responses and improved efficiency.\n\n**Prompt Caching is in beta**\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that Prompt Caching is now in public beta! To access this feature, you\u2019ll need to include the `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31` header in your API requests.\n\nWe\u2019ll be iterating on this open beta over the coming weeks, so we appreciate your feedback. Please share your ideas and suggestions using this [form](https://forms.gle/igS4go9TeLAgrYzn7).\n\n* * *\n"

      "text": "What is the cache lifetime?\n\nThe cache has a lifetime (TTL) of about 5 minutes. This lifetime is refreshed each time the cached content is used.\n\nHow many cache breakpoints can I use?\n\nYou can define up to 4 cache breakpoints in your prompt.\n\nIs Prompt Caching available for all models?\n\nNo, Prompt Caching is currently only available for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku, and Claude 3 Opus.\n\nHow do I enable Prompt Caching?\n\nTo enable Prompt Caching, include the `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31` header in your API requests.\n\nCan I use Prompt Caching with other API features?\n\nYes, Prompt Caching can be used alongside other API features like tool use and vision capabilities. However, changing whether there are images in a prompt or modifying tool use settings will break the cache.\n\nHow does Prompt Caching affect pricing?\n\nPrompt Caching introduces a new pricing structure where cache writes cost 25% more than base input tokens, while cache hits cost only 10% of the base input token price.\n\nCan I manually clear the cache?\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s no way to manually clear the cache. Cached prefixes automatically expire after 5 minutes of inactivity.\n\nHow can I track the effectiveness of my caching strategy?\n\nYou can monitor cache performance using the `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` fields in the API response.\n\nWhat can break the cache?\n\nChanges that can break the cache include modifying any content, change whether there are any images (anywhere in the prompt) and altering `tool_choice.type`. These changes will require creating a new cache entry.\n\nHow does Prompt Caching handle privacy and data separation?\n\nPrompt Caching is designed with strong privacy and data separation measures:\n\n1. Cache keys are generated using a cryptographic hash of the prompts up to the cache control point. This means only requests with identical prompts can access a specific cache.\n\n2. Caches are organization-specific. Users within the same organization can access the same cache if they use identical prompts, but caches are not shared across different organizations, even for identical prompts.\n\n3. The caching mechanism is designed to maintain the integrity and privacy of each unique conversation or context.\n\n4. It\u2019s safe to use cache\\_control anywhere in your prompts. For cost efficiency, it\u2019s better to exclude highly variable parts (e.g., user\u2019s arbitrary input) from caching.\n\n\nThese measures ensure that Prompt Caching maintains data privacy and security while offering performance benefits.\n\nCan I use Prompt Caching at the same time as other betas?\n\nYes! The `anthropic-beta` header takes a comma-separated list, for example `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31,max-tokens-3-5-sonnet-2024-07-15`.\n\n[Tool use (function calling)](/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use) [Reduce hallucinations](/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/reduce-hallucinations)\n\nOn this page\n\n- [How Prompt Caching works](#how-prompt-caching-works)\n- [Pricing](#pricing)\n- [How to implement Prompt Caching](#how-to-implement-prompt-caching)\n- [Supported models](#supported-models)\n- [Structuring your prompt](#structuring-your-prompt)\n- [Cache Limitations](#cache-limitations)\n- [What can be cached](#what-can-be-cached)\n- [Tracking cache performance](#tracking-cache-performance)\n- [Best practices for effective caching](#best-practices-for-effective-caching)\n- [Optimizing for different use cases](#optimizing-for-different-use-cases)\n- [Troubleshooting common issues](#troubleshooting-common-issues)\n- [Cache Storage and Sharing](#cache-storage-and-sharing)\n- [Prompt Caching examples](#prompt-caching-examples)\n- [FAQ](#faq)\n",

      "text": "Here are some key indicators that you should use an LLM like Claude instead of a traditional ML or rules-based approach for content moderation:\n\nYou want a cost-effective and rapid implementation\n\nTraditional ML methods require significant engineering resources, ML expertise, and infrastructure costs. Human moderation systems incur even higher costs. With Claude, you can have a sophisticated moderation system up and running in a fraction of the time for a fraction of the price.\n\nYou desire both semantic understanding and quick decisions\n\nTraditional ML approaches, such as bag-of-words models or simple pattern matching, often struggle to understand the tone, intent, and context of the content. While human moderation systems excel at understanding semantic meaning, they require time for content to be reviewed. Claude bridges the gap by combining semantic understanding with the ability to deliver moderation decisions quickly.\n\nYou need consistent policy decisions\n\nBy leveraging its advanced reasoning capabilities, Claude can interpret and apply complex moderation guidelines uniformly. This consistency helps ensure fair treatment of all content, reducing the risk of inconsistent or biased moderation decisions that can undermine user trust.\n\nYour moderation policies are likely to change or evolve over time\n\nOnce a traditional ML approach has been established, changing it is a laborious and data-intensive undertaking. On the other hand, as your product or customer needs evolve, Claude can easily adapt to changes or additions to moderation policies without extensive relabeling of training data.\n\nYou require interpretable reasoning for your moderation decisions\n\nIf you wish to provide users or regulators with clear explanations behind moderation decisions, Claude can generate detailed and coherent justifications. This transparency is important for building trust and ensuring accountability in content moderation practices.\n\nYou need multilingual support without maintaining separate models\n\nTraditional ML approaches typically require separate models or extensive translation processes for each supported language. Human moderation requires hiring a workforce fluent in each supported language. Claude\u2019s multilingual capabilities allow it to classify tickets in various languages without the need for separate models or extensive translation processes, streamlining moderation for global customer bases.\n\nYou require multimodal support\n\nClaude\u2019s multimodal capabilities allow it to analyze and interpret content across both text and images. This makes it a versatile tool for comprehensive content moderation in environments where different media types need to be evaluated together.\n\nAnthropic has trained all Claude models to be honest, helpful and harmless. This may result in Claude moderating content deemed particularly dangerous (in line with our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup)), regardless of the prompt used. For example, an adult website that wants to allow users to post explicit sexual content may find that Claude still flags explicit content as requiring moderation, even if they specify in their prompt not to moderate explicit sexual content. We recommend reviewing our AUP in advance of building a moderation solution.\n",

In the comment, `This movie was great, I really enjoyed it.

Conversely, despite the lack of explicit mentions of violence, the comment `Delete this post now or you better hide. I am coming after you and your family.` should be flagged by the content moderation system.\n\nThe `unsafe_categories` list can be customized to fit your specific needs.

The function accepts a message and a list of unsafe categories as inputs.\n\nWithin the function, a prompt is generated for Claude, including the message to be assessed, the unsafe categories, and specific instructions for evaluating the risk level. The prompt instructs Claude to respond with a JSON object that includes the risk level, the violated categories, and an optional explanation.\n\nThis approach enables flexible content moderation by assigning risk levels. It can be seamlessly integrated into a larger system to automate content filtering or flag comments for human review based on their assessed risk level. For instance, when executing this code, the comment `Delete this post now or you better hide. I am coming after you and your family.` is identified as high risk due to its dangerous threat. Conversely, the comment `Stay away from the 5G cellphones!! They are using 5G to control you.` is categorized as medium risk.\n",

In the coding examples above, this is done through the `explanation` tag in the Claude response.\n\n2. **Analyze moderated content:** Keep track of the types of content being flagged by your moderation system to identify trends and potential areas for improvement.\n\n3. **Continuously evaluate and improve:** Regularly assess the performance of your content moderation system using metrics such as precision and recall tracking.

The prompt directs Claude to return a JSON object listing all messages that contain violations. Each message in the response is identified by its id, which corresponds to the message\u2019s position in the input list.\nKeep in mind that finding the optimal batch size for your specific needs may require some experimentation. While larger batch sizes can lower costs, they might also lead to a slight decrease in quality. Additionally, you may need to increase the `max_tokens` parameter in the Claude API call to accommodate longer responses. For details on the maximum number of tokens your chosen model can output, refer to the [model comparison page](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models#model-comparison).\n\n[**Content moderation cookbook** \\\\\n\\\\\nView a fully implemented code-based example of how to use Claude for content moderation.](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/misc/building%5Fmoderation%5Ffilter.ipynb) [**Guardrails guide** \\\\\n\\\\\nExplore our guardrails guide for techniques to moderate interactions with Claude.](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/reduce-hallucinations)\n\n[Customer support agent](/en/docs/about-claude/use-case-guides/customer-support-chat) [Legal summarization](/en/docs/about-claude/use-case-guides/legal-summarization)\n\nOn this page\n\n- [Before building with Claude](#before-building-with-claude)\n- [Decide whether to use Claude for content moderation](#decide-whether-to-use-claude-for-content-moderation)\n- [Generate examples of content to moderate](#generate-examples-of-content-to-moderate)\n- [How to moderate content using Claude](#how-to-moderate-content-using-claude)\n- [Select the right Claude model](#select-the-right-claude-model)\n- [Build a strong prompt](#build-a-strong-prompt)\n- [Evaluate your prompt](#evaluate-your-prompt)\n- [Deploy your prompt](#deploy-your-prompt)\n- [Improve performance](#improve-performance)\n- [Define topics and provide examples](#define-topics-and-provide-examples)\n- [Consider batch processing](#consider-batch-processing)\n",

It\u2019s a simple, unambiguous metric that\u2019s perfect for tasks with clear-cut, categorical answers like sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral).\n\n**Example eval test cases**: 1000 tweets with human-labeled sentiments.\n\nCopy\n\n```python\nimport anthropic\n\ntweets = [\\\n    {\"text\": \"This movie was a total waste of time. \ud83d\udc4e\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\"},\\\n    {\"text\": \"The new album is \ud83d\udd25!

Values closer to 1 indicate higher similarity. It\u2019s ideal for evaluating consistency because similar questions should yield semantically similar answers, even if the wording varies.\n\n**Example eval test cases**: 50 groups with a few paraphrased versions each.\n\nCopy\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport numpy as np\nimport anthropic\n\nfaq_variations = [\\\n    {\"questions\": [\"What's your return policy?\", \"How can I return an item?\", \"Wut's yur retrn polcy?\"], \"answer\": \"Our return policy allows...\"},  # Edge case: Typos\\\n    {\"questions\": [\"I bought something last week, and it's not really what I expected, so I was wondering if maybe I could possibly return it?\", \"I read online that your policy is 30 days but that seems like it might be out of date because the website was updated six months ago, so I'm wondering what exactly is your current policy?\"], \"answer\": \"Our return policy allows...\"},  # Edge case: Long, rambling question\\\n    {\"questions\": [\"I'm Jane's cousin, and she said you guys have great customer service.

The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere $500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create.<br>In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest. It exposes us to undue risk, limits our recourse in case of failures, and compromises our intellectual property rights. I recommend renegotiating these terms or seeking alternative vendors. | <findings><br>1\\. Indemnification (Clause 8):<br> \\- Issue: Overly broad. We indemnify vendor against \u201cany and all claims\u201d arising from our use.<br> \\- Risk: Could hold us liable even for vendor\u2019s negligence or product defects.<br> \\- Deviation: Our standard limits indemnity to claims arising from our violation of agreement.<br>2\\. Limitation of Liability (Clause 9):<br> \\- Issue: Caps all damages at $500, including direct damages.<br> \\- Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use.

Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years).<br>2\\. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there\u2019s a downturn close to when they need the funds.<br>3\\. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there\u2019s less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.<br>While the stock\u2019s historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it\u2019s time to make the down payment. |\n\nExample: Financial analysis with thinking\n\nWith step-by-step thinking, the advisor provides a much richer analysis.

Understand the client\u2019s goal and timeline:<br> \\- Goal: Down payment for a house<br> \\- Timeline: 5 years<br> \\- Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.<br>2\\. Analyze Option A (Stock):<br> \\- Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)<br> \\- Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)<br> \\- Calculate potential 5-year return:<br> \\- Best case (12% annually): $10,000 \\* (1.12)^5 \u2248 $17,623.42<br> \\- Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = $5,000<br>3\\.

When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation.\n\nEach input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages. The first message must always use the `user` role.\n\nIf the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.\n\nExample with a single `user` message:\n\n```json\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]\n\n```\n\nExample with multiple conversational turns:\n\n```json\n[\\\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello there.\"},\\\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?\"},\\\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you explain LLMs in plain English?\"},\\\n]\n\n```\n\nExample with a partially-filled response from Claude:\n\n```json\n[\\\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun\"},\\\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The best answer is (\"},\\\n]\n\n```\n\nEach input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `\"text\"`. The following input messages are equivalent:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, Claude\"}\n\n```\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Hello, Claude\"}]}\n\n```\n\nStarting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\\\n  {\\\n    \"type\": \"image\",\\\n    \"source\": {\\\n      \"type\": \"base64\",\\\n      \"media_type\": \"image/jpeg\",\\\n      \"data\": \"/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...\",\\\n    }\\\n  },\\\n  {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is in this image?\"}\\\n]}\n\n```\n\nWe currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.\n\nSee [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for more input examples.\n\nNote that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter \u2014 there is no `\"system\"` role for input messages in the Messages API.\n\nShow child attributes\n\nmessages.role\n\nenum<string>\n\nrequired\n\nAvailable options:\n\n`user`,\n\n`assistant`\n\nmessages.content\n\nstringobject\\[\\]\n\nrequired\n\nmax\\_tokens\n\ninteger\n\nrequired\n\nThe maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.\n\nNote that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum.

Before you start building, break down your ideal customer interaction into every task you want Claude to be able to perform. This ensures you can prompt and evaluate Claude for every task, and gives you a good sense of the range of interactions you need to account for when writing test cases.\n\nCustomers sometimes find it helpful to visualize this as an interaction flowchart of possible conversation inflection points depending on user requests.\n\nHere are the key tasks associated with the example insurance interaction above:\n\n1. Greeting and general guidance\n   - Warmly greet the customer and initiate conversation\n   - Provide general information about the company and interaction\n2. Product Information\n   - Provide information about electric vehicle coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     This will require that Claude have the necessary information in its context, and might imply that a [RAG integration](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/retrieval_augmented_generation/guide.ipynb) is necessary.\n\n   - Answer questions related to unique electric vehicle insurance needs\n   - Answer follow-up questions about the quote or insurance details\n   - Offer links to sources when appropriate\n3. Conversation Management\n   - Stay on topic (car insurance)\n   - Redirect off-topic questions back to relevant subjects\n4. Quote Generation\n   - Ask appropriate questions to determine quote eligibility\n   - Adapt questions based on customer responses\n   - Submit collected information to quote generation API\n   - Present the provided quote to the customer\n",

Measure this by reviewing a sample of conversations and assessing whether Claude has the correct interpretation of customer intent, critical next steps, what successful resolution looks like, and more. Aim for a comprehension accuracy of 95% or higher.\n\nResponse relevance\n\nThis assesses how well Claude\u2019s response addresses the customer\u2019s specific question or issue. Evaluate a set of conversations and rate the relevance of each response (using LLM-based grading for scale). Target a relevance score of 90% or above.\n\nResponse accuracy\n\nAssess the correctness of general company and product information provided to the user, based on the information provided to Claude in context. Target 100% accuracy in this introductory information.\n\nCitation provision relevance\n\nTrack the frequency and relevance of links or sources offered. Target providing relevant sources in 80% of interactions where additional information could be beneficial.\n\nTopic adherence\n\nMeasure how well Claude stays on topic, such as the topic of car insurance in our example implementation. Aim for 95% of responses to be directly related to car insurance or the customer\u2019s specific query.\n\nContent generation effectiveness\n\nMeasure how successful Claude is at determining when to generate informational content and how relevant that content is. For example, in our implementation, we would be determining how well Claude understands when to generate a quote and how accurate that quote is. Target 100% accuracy, as this is vital information for a successful customer interaction.\n\nEscalation efficiency\n\nThis measures Claude\u2019s ability to recognize when a query needs human intervention and escalate appropriately. Track the percentage of correctly escalated conversations versus those that should have been escalated but weren\u2019t. Aim for an escalation accuracy of 95% or higher.\n\nHere are criteria and benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the business impact of employing Claude for support:\n\nSentiment maintenance\n\nThis assesses Claude\u2019s ability to maintain or improve customer sentiment throughout the conversation. Use sentiment analysis tools to measure sentiment at the beginning and end of each conversation. Aim for maintained or improved sentiment in 90% of interactions.\n\nDeflection rate\n\nThe percentage of customer inquiries successfully handled by the chatbot without human intervention. Typically aim for 70-80% deflection rate, depending on the complexity of inquiries.\n\nCustomer satisfaction score\n\nA measure of how satisfied customers are with their chatbot interaction. Usually done through post-interaction surveys. Aim for a CSAT score of 4 out of 5 or higher.\n\nAverage handle time\n\nThe average time it takes for the chatbot to resolve an inquiry. This varies widely based on the complexity of issues, but generally, aim for a lower AHT compared to human agents.\n",

Unfortunately, we don't offer commercial insurance at this time.\nHowever, we do provide a range of personal insurance products including car insurance and electric car insurance.\nWould you like to know more about these offerings?\n</example 1>\n\n<example 2>\nH: Hi, what are your business hours?\n\nA: Our business hours are Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM EST.\nIf you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out during those times.\nHow else can I assist you today?\n</example 2>\n\n<example 3>\nH: I'm shopping for car insurance. What does Acme offer?\n\nA: Great choice! Acme's car insurance policies typically include:\n- Liability coverage: Protects you if you're at fault in an accident\n- Collision coverage: Pays for damage to your car in an accident\n- Comprehensive coverage: Covers non-collision incidents like theft or vandalism\n- Medical payments coverage: Pays for medical expenses after an accident\n- Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage: Protects you from drivers with insufficient insurance\n\nWe also offer optional coverages like rental car reimbursement, roadside assistance, and new car replacement.\nWould you like more details on any of these coverages, or do you have specific questions about insuring your vehicle?\n</example 3>\n\n<example 4>\nH: I'd like to hear about your electric car insurance.\n\nA: Certainly! Our electric car insurance is specially designed to meet the unique needs of electric vehicle owners.\nIn addition to all the standard coverages we offer for regular cars, our electric car policies include:\n\n- Battery coverage: Protection against damage or degradation of your vehicle's expensive battery system\n- Tech package: Covers repairs or replacement of advanced electronics and onboard computer systems\n- Charging station coverage: Protects both home and portable charging equipment\n- Cybersecurity protection: Coverage against hacking or digital threats\n- Specialized roadside assistance: Includes flatbed towing to protect the vehicle's undercarriage\n\nWe cover a wide range of electric vehicles, including popular models from Tesla, Rivian, Nissan, Chevrolet, and more.\nIs there a specific electric vehicle you're looking to insure, or would you like more details on any of these coverages?\n</example 4>\n\n<example 5>\nH: I'd like to get a quote for my car insurance.\n\nA: Certainly! I'd be happy to help you get a quote for your car insurance.\nTo provide you with an accurate quote, I'll need to collect some information about your vehicle and the primary driver.\nLet's start with the basics:\n\n1. What is the make and model of your vehicle?\n2. What year was it manufactured?\n3. Approximately how many miles have you driven?\n4. What is the age of the primary driver?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I'll use our quoting tool to generate a personalized insurance quote for you.\n</example 5>\n\"\"\"\n\n```\n\nYou will also want to include any important instructions outlining Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for how Claude should interact with the customer.\nThis may draw from brand guardrails or support policies.\n\nCopy\n\n```python\nADDITIONAL_GUARDRAILS = \"\"\"Please adhere to the following guardrails:\n1. Only provide information about insurance types listed in our offerings.\n2. If asked about an insurance type we don't offer, politely state\nthat we don't provide that service.\n3.

Your HTTP service could accept the user input and return the Assistant response in its entirety. Thus, your service could have the following characteristics:\n   - Server-Sent Events (SSE): SSE allows for real-time streaming of responses from the server to the client. This is crucial for providing a smooth, interactive experience when working with LLMs.\n   - Caching: Implementing caching can significantly improve response times and reduce unnecessary API calls.\n   - Context retention: Maintaining context when a user navigates away and returns is important for continuity in conversations.\n2.

      "text": "Minimize the number of tokens in both your input prompt and the expected output, while still maintaining high performance. The fewer tokens the model has to process and generate, the faster the response will be.\n\nHere are some tips to help you optimize your prompts and outputs:\n\n- **Be clear but concise**: Aim to convey your intent clearly and concisely in the prompt. Avoid unnecessary details or redundant information, while keeping in mind that [claude lacks context](/en/docs/be-clear-direct) on your use case and may not make the intended leaps of logic if instructions are unclear.\n- **Ask for shorter responses:**: Ask Claude directly to be concise. The Claude 3 family of models has improved steerability over previous generations. If Claude is outputting unwanted length, ask Claude to [curb its chattiness](/en/docs/be-clear-direct#provide-detailed-context-and-instructions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to how LLMs count [tokens](/en/docs/glossary#tokens) instead of words, asking for an exact word count or a word count limit is not as effective a strategy as asking for paragraph or sentence count limits.\n\n- **Set appropriate output limits**: Use the `max_tokens` parameter to set a hard limit on the maximum length of the generated response. This prevents Claude from generating overly long outputs.\n\n\n> **Note**: When the response reaches `max_tokens` tokens, the response will be cut off, perhaps midsentence or mid-word, so this is a blunt technique that may require post-processing and is usually most appropriate for multiple choice or short answer responses where the answer comes right at the beginning.\n\n- **Experiment with temperature**: The `temperature` [parameter](/en/api/messages) controls the randomness of the output. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) can sometimes lead to more focused and shorter responses, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) may result in more diverse but potentially longer outputs.\n\nFinding the right balance between prompt clarity, output quality, and token count may require some experimentation.\n",

For example, latency and cost can be sometimes more easily improved by selecting a different model.\n\nPrompting vs. finetuning\n\nPrompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning:\n\n- **Resource efficiency**: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly.\n- **Cost-effectiveness**: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper.\n- **Maintaining model updates**: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.\n- **Time-saving**: Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving.\n- **Minimal data needs**: Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning.\n- **Flexibility & rapid iteration**: Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning.\n- **Domain adaptation**: Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.\n- **Comprehension improvements**: Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents\n- **Preserves general knowledge**: Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model\u2019s broad capabilities.\n- **Transparency**: Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.\n\n* * *\n",

      "text": "Here are some key indicators that you should employ an LLM like Claude to summarize legal documents:\n\nYou want to review a high volume of documents efficiently and affordably\n\nLarge-scale document review can be time-consuming and expensive when done manually. Claude can process and summarize vast amounts of legal documents rapidly, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with document review. This capability is particularly valuable for tasks like due diligence, contract analysis, or litigation discovery, where efficiency is crucial.\n\nYou require automated extraction of key metadata\n\nClaude can efficiently extract and categorize important metadata from legal documents, such as parties involved, dates, contract terms, or specific clauses. This automated extraction can help organize information, making it easier to search, analyze, and manage large document sets. It\u2019s especially useful for contract management, compliance checks, or creating searchable databases of legal information.\n\nYou want to generate clear, concise, and standardized summaries\n\nClaude can generate structured summaries that follow predetermined formats, making it easier for legal professionals to quickly grasp the key points of various documents. These standardized summaries can improve readability, facilitate comparison between documents, and enhance overall comprehension, especially when dealing with complex legal language or technical jargon.\n\nYou need precise citations for your summaries\n\nWhen creating legal summaries, proper attribution and citation are crucial to ensure credibility and compliance with legal standards. Claude can be prompted to include accurate citations for all referenced legal points, making it easier for legal professionals to review and verify the summarized information.\n\nYou want to streamline and expedite your legal research process\n\nClaude can assist in legal research by quickly analyzing large volumes of case law, statutes, and legal commentary. It can identify relevant precedents, extract key legal principles, and summarize complex legal arguments. This capability can significantly speed up the research process, allowing legal professionals to focus on higher-level analysis and strategy development.\n",

If the audience is not legal experts, the summarization should not include legal jargon that could confuse the audience.\n\nBias and fairness\n\nThe summary should present an unbiased and fair depiction of the legal arguments and positions.\n\nSee our guide on [establishing success criteria](/en/docs/build-with-claude/define-success) for more information.\n\n* * *\n",

      "text": "Prompting often requires testing and optimization for it to be production ready. To determine the readiness of your solution, evaluate the quality of your summaries using a systematic process combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Creating a [strong empirical evaluation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/develop-tests#building-evals-and-test-cases) based on your defined success criteria will allow you to optimize your prompts. Here are some metrics you may wish to include within your empirical evaluation:\n\nROUGE scores\n\nThis measures the overlap between the generated summary and an expert-created reference summary. This metric primarily focuses on recall and is useful for evaluating content coverage.\n\nBLEU scores\n\nWhile originally developed for machine translation, this metric can be adapted for summarization tasks. BLEU scores measure the precision of n-gram matches between the generated summary and reference summaries. A higher score indicates that the generated summary contains similar phrases and terminology to the reference summary.\n\nContextual embedding similarity\n\nThis metric involves creating vector representations (embeddings) of both the generated and reference summaries. The similarity between these embeddings is then calculated, often using cosine similarity. Higher similarity scores indicate that the generated summary captures the semantic meaning and context of the reference summary, even if the exact wording differs.\n\nLLM-based grading\n\nThis method involves using an LLM such as Claude to evaluate the quality of generated summaries against a scoring rubric. The rubric can be tailored to your specific needs, assessing key factors like accuracy, completeness, and coherence. For guidance on implementing LLM-based grading, view these [tips](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/develop-tests#tips-for-llm-based-grading).\n\nHuman evaluation\n\nIn addition to creating the reference summaries, legal experts can also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries. While this is expensive and time-consuming at scale, this is often done on a few summaries as a sanity check before deploying to production.\n",

Provide disclaimers or legal notices clarifying that the summaries are generated by AI and should be reviewed by legal professionals.\n\n2. **Handle diverse document types:** In this guide, we\u2019ve discussed how to extract text from PDFs. In the real-world, documents may come in a variety of formats (PDFs, Word documents, text files, etc.). Ensure your data extraction pipeline can convert all of the file formats you expect to receive.\n\n3. **Parallelize API calls to Claude:** Long documents with a large number of tokens may require up to a minute for Claude to generate a summary. For large document collections, you may want to send API calls to Claude in parallel so that the summaries can be completed in a reasonable timeframe. Refer to Anthropic\u2019s [rate limits](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#rate-limits) to determine the maximum amount of API calls that can be performed in parallel.\n\n\n* * *\n",

In this approach, you first use Claude to generate a concise summary for each document in your corpus, and then use Clade to rank the relevance of each summary to the query being asked.

      "text": "Another advanced technique to improve Claude\u2019s ability to generate summaries is fine-tuning. Fine-tuning involves training Claude on a custom dataset that specifically aligns with your legal summarization needs, ensuring that Claude adapts to your use case. Here\u2019s an overview on how to perform fine-tuning:\n\n1. **Identify errors:** Start by collecting instances where Claude\u2019s summaries fall short - this could include missing critical legal details, misunderstanding context, or using inappropriate legal terminology.\n\n2. **Curate a dataset:** Once you\u2019ve identified these issues, compile a dataset of these problematic examples. This dataset should include the original legal documents alongside your corrected summaries, ensuring that Claude learns the desired behavior.\n\n3. **Perform fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning involves retraining the model on your curated dataset to adjust its weights and parameters. This retraining helps Claude better understand the specific requirements of your legal domain, improving its ability to summarize documents according to your standards.\n\n4. **Iterative improvement:** Fine-tuning is not a one-time process. As Claude continues to generate summaries, you can iteratively add new examples where it has underperformed, further refining its capabilities. Over time, this continuous feedback loop will result in a model that is highly specialized for your legal summarization tasks.\n\n\nFine-tuning is currently only available via Amazon Bedrock.

      "text": "| Assistant<br>{{STRATEGY\\_DOC}} | \\# Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product<br>\\## Executive Summary<br>The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br>\\## Detailed Analysis<br>\\### 1\\. Scalability: B+<br>Strengths:<br>\\- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br>\\- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\\- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br>\\- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br>\\### 2\\. Security: B-<br>Strengths:<br>\\- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br>\\- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\\- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br>\\- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br>\\- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br>\\### 3\\. Cost-effectiveness: B<br>Strengths:<br>\\- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br>\\- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\\- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br>\\- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br>\\- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br>\\## Recommendations<br>1\\. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br>2\\. **Security Hardening**:<br> a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br> b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br> c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br>3\\. **Cost Optimization**:<br> a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br> b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br> c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br>4\\. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br> a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br> b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br> c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br>With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |\n",

Instead, it is specified in the Google Cloud endpoint URL.\n- In Vertex, `anthropic_version` is passed in the request body (rather than as a header), and must be set to the value `vertex-2023-10-16`.\n\nVertex is also supported by Anthropic\u2019s official [client SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks). This guide will walk you through the process of making a request to Claude on Vertex AI in either Python or TypeScript.\n\nNote that this guide assumes you have already have a GCP project that is able to use Vertex AI. See [using the Claude 3 models from Anthropic](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude) for more information on the setup required, as well as a full walkthrough.\n"

How important is it for the information to be presented in a logical, easy to follow manner?\n\nTone and style\n\nHow well does the model\u2019s output style match expectations? How appropriate is its language for the target audience?\n\nPrivacy preservation\n\nWhat is a successful metric for how the model handles personal or sensitive information? Can it follow instructions not to use or share certain details?\n\nContext utilization\n\nHow effectively does the model use provided context? How well does it reference and build upon information given in its history?\n\nLatency\n\nWhat is the acceptable response time for the model? This will depend on your application\u2019s real-time requirements and user expectations.\n\nPrice\n\nWhat is your budget for running the model?
