    "summary": "LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and utilities for creating complex conversational agents, managing state, streaming outputs, and implementing various agent architectures. Key features include the ability to create custom agents, manage conversation history, add persistence and memory, implement human-in-the-loop processes, and visualize agent workflows. LangGraph supports multiple streaming modes, allows for the creation of subgraphs and parallel execution branches, and offers integration with LangChain for additional functionality. The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing developers to build sophisticated AI applications with features like adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-agent collaboration, and complex reasoning patterns.",
