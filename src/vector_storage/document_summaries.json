    "summary": "This comprehensive API reference documentation covers a wide range of topics related to large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and AI agents. The content is structured with multiple top-level headers (h1) including Introspective, OpenAI, Wandb, LiteLLM, Hugging Face, and various AI service providers. Numerous subheaders (h2) detail specific classes and modules for embeddings, agents, evaluators, and callback handlers.\n\nKey features include implementations for various embedding models (e.g., OpenAI, Azure, Cohere, Hugging Face), agent types (e.g., ReAct, OpenAI Assistant), and evaluation metrics. The documentation also covers integration with popular AI platforms and tools such as Langchain, Bedrock, and Vertex AI.\n\nNotable sections include core agent classes, callback handlers, dataset generation, and multimodal retrieval. The content appears to be highly technical, with code samples and method signatures provided for many classes and functions. This documentation serves as a detailed reference for developers working with LLMs, embeddings, and AI agents, offering a wealth of information on implementation details and available options across various platforms and services."
