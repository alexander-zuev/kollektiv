    "summary": "This documentation covers Anthropic's Claude, an advanced AI model with various capabilities and use cases. It includes guides on prompt engineering, API usage, model versions, and integration with platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex AI. Key features include text generation, vision capabilities, embeddings, and tool use (function calling). The documentation provides instructions on migrating from older models, reducing hallucinations, and implementing Claude for tasks such as legal summarization, ticket routing, and content moderation. It also covers important aspects like rate limits, error handling, and best practices for effective prompt engineering and evaluation.",

    "summary": "LangGraph is a powerful framework for building complex language model applications. It offers features like streaming, state management, persistence, and human-in-the-loop capabilities. The documentation covers various aspects including creating ReAct agents, managing conversation history, handling tools, implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and building multi-agent systems. LangGraph supports different streaming modes, allows for custom data streaming, and provides visualization tools for graphs. It also includes tutorials on building customer support bots, implementing reflexion and self-RAG techniques, and creating hierarchical agent teams. The framework is designed to work with both open-source and proprietary language models, offering flexibility and extensibility for diverse use cases.",

    "summary": "This documentation covers real-time data functionality in the Alpaca-py library. It describes various subscription methods for accessing live market data, including stock data streams, daily bars, and trading status updates. The API allows users to subscribe to specific symbols or all available data using '*'. The documentation provides details on callback functions for handling incoming data, which are typically coroutine functions expecting specific data types or dictionaries. The structure suggests this is part of an API reference, likely for developers integrating real-time market data into their trading applications or analysis tools.",
