    "summary": "LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-step applications with language models. It provides tools for creating complex agent workflows, managing graph state, streaming outputs, and integrating with various models and tools. Key features include support for persistence, human-in-the-loop processes, custom checkpointing, and visualization of agent graphs. LangGraph enables developers to build sophisticated AI applications like multi-agent systems, agentic RAG, and complex reasoning chains. It offers flexibility in defining graph structures, state management, and integration with LangChain components.",
