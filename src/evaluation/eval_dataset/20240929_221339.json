Each message in the response is identified by its id, which corresponds to the message\u2019s position in the input list.\nKeep in mind that finding the optimal batch size for your specific needs may require some experimentation. While larger batch sizes can lower costs, they might also lead to a slight decrease in quality. Additionally, you may need to increase the <code>max_tokens</code> parameter in the Claude API call to accommodate longer responses.

If you\u2019re looking for guidance on moderating interactions with Claude, please refer to our [guardrails guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/reduce-hallucinations).\nHere are some key indicators that you should use an LLM like Claude instead of a traditional ML or rules-based approach for content moderation:\n\nYou want a cost-effective and rapid implementation\n\nTraditional ML methods require significant engineering resources, ML expertise, and infrastructure costs. Human moderation systems incur even higher costs. With Claude, you can have a sophisticated moderation system up and running in a fraction of the time for a fraction of the price.\n\nYou desire both semantic understanding and quick decisions\n\nTraditional ML approaches, such as bag-of-words models or simple pattern matching, often struggle to understand the tone, intent, and context of the content. While human moderation systems excel at understanding semantic meaning, they require time for content to be reviewed. Claude bridges the gap by combining semantic understanding with the ability to deliver moderation decisions quickly.\n\nYou need consistent policy decisions\n\nBy leveraging its advanced reasoning capabilities, Claude can interpret and apply complex moderation guidelines uniformly. This consistency helps ensure fair treatment of all content, reducing the risk of inconsistent or biased moderation decisions that can undermine user trust.\n\nYour moderation policies are likely to change or evolve over time\n\nOnce a traditional ML approach has been established, changing it is a laborious and data-intensive undertaking. On the other hand, as your product or customer needs evolve, Claude can easily adapt to changes or additions to moderation policies without extensive relabeling of training data.\n\nYou require interpretable reasoning for your moderation decisions\n\nIf you wish to provide users or regulators with clear explanations behind moderation decisions, Claude can generate detailed and coherent justifications. This transparency is important for building trust and ensuring accountability in content moderation practices.\n\nYou need multilingual support without maintaining separate models\n\nTraditional ML approaches typically require separate models or extensive translation processes for each supported language. Human moderation requires hiring a workforce fluent in each supported language. Claude\u2019s multilingual capabilities allow it to classify tickets in various languages without the need for separate models or extensive translation processes, streamlining moderation for global customer bases.\n\nYou require multimodal support\n\nClaude\u2019s multimodal capabilities allow it to analyze and interpret content across both text and images. This makes it a versatile tool for comprehensive content moderation in environments where different media types need to be evaluated together.\n\nAnthropic has trained all Claude models to be honest, helpful and harmless. This may result in Claude moderating content deemed particularly dangerous (in line with our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup)), regardless of the prompt used. For example, an adult website that wants to allow users to post explicit sexual content may find that Claude still flags explicit content as requiring moderation, even if they specify in their prompt not to moderate explicit sexual content. We recommend reviewing our AUP in advance of building a moderation solution.\n"

It\u2019s crucial for maintaining routing reliability. Measure this by periodically testing the model with a set of standardized inputs and aiming for a consistency rate of 95% or higher.\n\nAdaptation speed\n\nThis measures how quickly Claude can adapt to new categories or changing ticket patterns. Test this by introducing new ticket types and measuring the time it takes for the model to achieve satisfactory accuracy (e.g., >90%) on these new categories. Aim for adaptation within 50-100 sample tickets.\n\nMultilingual handling\n\nThis assesses Claude\u2019s ability to accurately route tickets in multiple languages. Measure the routing accuracy across different languages, aiming for no more than a 5-10% drop in accuracy for non-primary languages.\n\nEdge case handling\n\nThis evaluates Claude\u2019s performance on unusual or complex tickets. Create a test set of edge cases and measure the routing accuracy, aiming for at least 80% accuracy on these challenging inputs.\n\nBias mitigation\n\nThis measures Claude\u2019s fairness in routing across different customer demographics. Regularly audit routing decisions for potential biases, aiming for consistent routing accuracy (within 2-3%) across all customer groups.\n\nPrompt efficiency\n\nIn situations where minimizing token count is crucial, this criteria assesses how well Claude performs with minimal context. Measure routing accuracy with varying amounts of context provided, aiming for 90%+ accuracy with just the ticket title and a brief description.\n\nExplainability score\n\nThis evaluates the quality and relevance of Claude\u2019s explanations for its routing decisions. Human raters can score explanations on a scale (e.g., 1-5), with the goal of achieving an average score of 4 or higher.\n\nHere are some common success criteria that may be useful regardless of whether an LLM is used:\n\nRouting accuracy\n\nRouting accuracy measures how often tickets are correctly assigned to the appropriate team or individual on the first try. This is typically measured as a percentage of correctly routed tickets out of total tickets. Industry benchmarks often aim for 90-95% accuracy, though this can vary based on the complexity of the support structure.\n\nTime-to-assignment\n\nThis metric tracks how quickly tickets are assigned after being submitted. Faster assignment times generally lead to quicker resolutions and improved customer satisfaction. Best-in-class systems often achieve average assignment times of under 5 minutes, with many aiming for near-instantaneous routing (which is possible with LLM implementations).\n\nRerouting rate\n\nThe rerouting rate indicates how often tickets need to be reassigned after initial routing. A lower rate suggests more accurate initial routing. Aim for a rerouting rate below 10%, with top-performing systems achieving rates as low as 5% or less.\n\nFirst-contact resolution rate\n\nThis measures the percentage of tickets resolved during the first interaction with the customer. Higher rates indicate efficient routing and well-prepared support teams. Industry benchmarks typically range from 70-75%, with top performers achieving rates of 80% or higher.\n\nAverage handling time\n\nAverage handling time measures how long it takes to resolve a ticket from start to finish. Efficient routing can significantly reduce this time. Benchmarks vary widely by industry and complexity, but many organizations aim to keep average handling time under 24 hours for non-critical issues.\n\nCustomer satisfaction scores\n\nOften measured through post-interaction surveys, these scores reflect overall customer happiness with the support process. Effective routing contributes to higher satisfaction. Aim for CSAT scores of 90% or higher, with top performers often achieving 95%+ satisfaction rates.\n\nEscalation rate\n\n"

We recommend reviewing our AUP in advance of building a moderation solution.\nBefore developing a content moderation solution, first create examples of content that should be flagged and content that should not be flagged. Ensure that you include edge cases and challenging scenarios that may be difficult for a content moderation system to handle effectively. Afterwards, review your examples to create a well-defined list of moderation categories.\nFor instance, the examples generated by a social media platform might include the following:\n\nCopy\n\n```python\nallowed_user_comments = [\\\n    'This movie was great, I really enjoyed it. The main actor really killed it!',\\\n    'I hate Mondays.',\\\n    'It is a great time to invest in gold!'\\\n]\n\ndisallowed_user_comments = [\\\n    'Delete this post now or you better hide. I am coming after you and your family.',\\\n    'Stay away from the 5G cellphones!! They are using 5G to control you.',\\\n    'Congratulations! You have won a $1,000 gift card. Click here to claim your prize!'\\\n]\n\n# Sample user comments to test the content moderation\nuser_comments = allowed_user_comments + disallowed_user_comments\n\n# List of categories considered unsafe for content moderation\nunsafe_categories = [\\\n    'Child Exploitation',\\\n    'Conspiracy Theories',\\\n    'Hate',\\\n    'Indiscriminate Weapons',\\\n    'Intellectual Property',\\\n    'Non-Violent Crimes',\\\n    'Privacy',\\\n    'Self-Harm',\\\n    'Sex Crimes',\\\n    'Sexual Content',\\\n    'Specialized Advice',\\\n    'Violent Crimes'\\\n]\n\n```\n\nEffectively moderating these examples requires a nuanced understanding of language. In the comment, <code>This movie was great, I really enjoyed it. The main actor really killed it!</code>, the content moderation system needs to recognize that \u201ckilled it\u201d is a metaphor, not an indication of actual violence. Conversely, despite the lack of explicit mentions of violence, the comment <code>Delete this post now or you better hide. I am coming after you and your family.</code> should be flagged by the content moderation system.\n\nThe <code>unsafe_categories</code> list can be customized to fit your specific needs. For example, if you wish to prevent minors from creating content on your website, you could append \u201cUnderage Posting\u201d to the list.\n"

The prompt directs Claude to return a JSON object listing all messages that contain violations. Each message in the response is identified by its id, which corresponds to the message\u2019s position in the input list.\nKeep in mind that finding the optimal batch size for your specific needs may require some experimentation. While larger batch sizes can lower costs, they might also lead to a slight decrease in quality. Additionally, you may need to increase the <code>max_tokens</code> parameter in the Claude API call to accommodate longer responses.

If you\u2019re looking for guidance on moderating interactions with Claude, please refer to our [guardrails guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/reduce-hallucinations).\nHere are some key indicators that you should use an LLM like Claude instead of a traditional ML or rules-based approach for content moderation:\n\nYou want a cost-effective and rapid implementation\n\nTraditional ML methods require significant engineering resources, ML expertise, and infrastructure costs. Human moderation systems incur even higher costs. With Claude, you can have a sophisticated moderation system up and running in a fraction of the time for a fraction of the price.\n\nYou desire both semantic understanding and quick decisions\n\nTraditional ML approaches, such as bag-of-words models or simple pattern matching, often struggle to understand the tone, intent, and context of the content. While human moderation systems excel at understanding semantic meaning, they require time for content to be reviewed. Claude bridges the gap by combining semantic understanding with the ability to deliver moderation decisions quickly.\n\nYou need consistent policy decisions\n\nBy leveraging its advanced reasoning capabilities, Claude can interpret and apply complex moderation guidelines uniformly. This consistency helps ensure fair treatment of all content, reducing the risk of inconsistent or biased moderation decisions that can undermine user trust.\n\nYour moderation policies are likely to change or evolve over time\n\nOnce a traditional ML approach has been established, changing it is a laborious and data-intensive undertaking. On the other hand, as your product or customer needs evolve, Claude can easily adapt to changes or additions to moderation policies without extensive relabeling of training data.\n\nYou require interpretable reasoning for your moderation decisions\n\nIf you wish to provide users or regulators with clear explanations behind moderation decisions, Claude can generate detailed and coherent justifications. This transparency is important for building trust and ensuring accountability in content moderation practices.\n\nYou need multilingual support without maintaining separate models\n\nTraditional ML approaches typically require separate models or extensive translation processes for each supported language. Human moderation requires hiring a workforce fluent in each supported language. Claude\u2019s multilingual capabilities allow it to classify tickets in various languages without the need for separate models or extensive translation processes, streamlining moderation for global customer bases.\n\nYou require multimodal support\n\nClaude\u2019s multimodal capabilities allow it to analyze and interpret content across both text and images. This makes it a versatile tool for comprehensive content moderation in environments where different media types need to be evaluated together.\n\nAnthropic has trained all Claude models to be honest, helpful and harmless. This may result in Claude moderating content deemed particularly dangerous (in line with our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup)), regardless of the prompt used. For example, an adult website that wants to allow users to post explicit sexual content may find that Claude still flags explicit content as requiring moderation, even if they specify in their prompt not to moderate explicit sexual content. We recommend reviewing our AUP in advance of building a moderation solution.\n"

Be sure to consider other routing criteria when building your automated routing system.\nWork with your support team to [define clear success criteria](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/define-success) with measurable benchmarks, thresholds, and goals.\n\nHere are some standard criteria and benchmarks when using LLMs for support ticket routing:\n\nClassification consistency\n\nThis metric assesses how consistently Claude classifies similar tickets over time. It\u2019s crucial for maintaining routing reliability. Measure this by periodically testing the model with a set of standardized inputs and aiming for a consistency rate of 95% or higher.\n\nAdaptation speed\n\nThis measures how quickly Claude can adapt to new categories or changing ticket patterns. Test this by introducing new ticket types and measuring the time it takes for the model to achieve satisfactory accuracy (e.g., >90%) on these new categories. Aim for adaptation within 50-100 sample tickets.\n\nMultilingual handling\n\nThis assesses Claude\u2019s ability to accurately route tickets in multiple languages. Measure the routing accuracy across different languages, aiming for no more than a 5-10% drop in accuracy for non-primary languages.\n\nEdge case handling\n\nThis evaluates Claude\u2019s performance on unusual or complex tickets. Create a test set of edge cases and measure the routing accuracy, aiming for at least 80% accuracy on these challenging inputs.\n\nBias mitigation\n\nThis measures Claude\u2019s fairness in routing across different customer demographics. Regularly audit routing decisions for potential biases, aiming for consistent routing accuracy (within 2-3%) across all customer groups.\n\nPrompt efficiency\n\nIn situations where minimizing token count is crucial, this criteria assesses how well Claude performs with minimal context. Measure routing accuracy with varying amounts of context provided, aiming for 90%+ accuracy with just the ticket title and a brief description.\n\nExplainability score\n\nThis evaluates the quality and relevance of Claude\u2019s explanations for its routing decisions. Human raters can score explanations on a scale (e.g., 1-5), with the goal of achieving an average score of 4 or higher.\n\nHere are some common success criteria that may be useful regardless of whether an LLM is used:\n\nRouting accuracy\n\nRouting accuracy measures how often tickets are correctly assigned to the appropriate team or individual on the first try. This is typically measured as a percentage of correctly routed tickets out of total tickets. Industry benchmarks often aim for 90-95% accuracy, though this can vary based on the complexity of the support structure.\n\nTime-to-assignment\n\nThis metric tracks how quickly tickets are assigned after being submitted. Faster assignment times generally lead to quicker resolutions and improved customer satisfaction. Best-in-class systems often achieve average assignment times of under 5 minutes, with many aiming for near-instantaneous routing (which is possible with LLM implementations).\n\nRerouting rate\n\nThe rerouting rate indicates how often tickets need to be reassigned after initial routing. A lower rate suggests more accurate initial routing. Aim for a rerouting rate below 10%, with top-performing systems achieving rates as low as 5% or less.\n\nFirst-contact resolution rate\n\nThis measures the percentage of tickets resolved during the first interaction with the customer. Higher rates indicate efficient routing and well-prepared support teams. Industry benchmarks typically range from 70-75%, with top performers achieving rates of 80% or higher.\n\nAverage handling time\n\nAverage handling time measures how long it takes to resolve a ticket from start to finish. Efficient routing can significantly reduce this time. Benchmarks vary widely by industry and complexity, but many organizations aim to keep average handling time under 24 hours for non-critical issues.\n\nCustomer satisfaction scores\n\nOften measured through post-interaction surveys, these scores reflect overall customer happiness with the support process. Effective routing contributes to higher satisfaction. Aim for CSAT scores of 90% or higher, with top performers often achieving 95%+ satisfaction rates.\n\nEscalation rate\n\n"

Claude\u2019s pre-trained model can effectively classify tickets with just a few dozen labeled examples, significantly reducing data preparation time and costs.\n\nYour classification categories are likely to change or evolve over time\n\nOnce a traditional ML approach has been established, changing it is a laborious and data-intensive undertaking. On the other hand, as your product or customer needs evolve, Claude can easily adapt to changes in class definitions or new classes without extensive relabeling of training data.\n\nYou need to handle complex, unstructured text inputs\n\nTraditional ML models often struggle with unstructured data and require extensive feature engineering. Claude\u2019s advanced language understanding allows for accurate classification based on content and context, rather than relying on strict ontological structures.\n\nYour classification rules are based on semantic understanding\n\nTraditional ML approaches often rely on bag-of-words models or simple pattern matching. Claude excels at understanding and applying underlying rules when classes are defined by conditions rather than examples.\n\nYou require interpretable reasoning for classification decisions\n\nMany traditional ML models provide little insight into their decision-making process. Claude can provide human-readable explanations for its classification decisions, building trust in the automation system and facilitating easy adaptation if needed.\n\nYou want to handle edge cases and ambiguous tickets more effectively\n\nTraditional ML systems often struggle with outliers and ambiguous inputs, frequently misclassifying them or defaulting to a catch-all category. Claude\u2019s natural language processing capabilities allow it to better interpret context and nuance in support tickets, potentially reducing the number of misrouted or unclassified tickets that require manual intervention.\n\nYou need multilingual support without maintaining separate models\n\nTraditional ML approaches typically require separate models or extensive translation processes for each supported language. Claude\u2019s multilingual capabilities allow it to classify tickets in various languages without the need for separate models or extensive translation processes, streamlining support for global customer bases.\n"

If your classification problem requires deep subject matter expertise or a large volume of intent categories complex reasoning, you may opt for the [larger Sonnet model](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models).\nTicket routing is a type of classification task. Claude analyzes the content of a support ticket and classifies it into predefined categories based on the issue type, urgency, required expertise, or other relevant factors.\n\nLet\u2019s write a ticket classification prompt. Our initial prompt should contain the contents of the user request and return both the reasoning and the intent.\n\nTry the [prompt generator](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/prompt-generator) on the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/login) to have Claude write a first draft for you.\n\nHere\u2019s an example ticket routing classification prompt:\n\nCopy\n\n```python\ndef classify_support_request(ticket_contents):\n    # Define the prompt for the classification task\n    classification_prompt = f\"\"\"You will be acting as a customer support ticket classification system.

Thus, you can use the same techniques outlined in our [classification cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/classification/guide.ipynb) to determine the accuracy of your content moderation system.\n\nOne additional consideration is that instead of treating content moderation as a binary classification problem, you may instead create multiple categories to represent various risk levels. Creating multiple risk levels allows you to adjust the aggressiveness of your moderation.
