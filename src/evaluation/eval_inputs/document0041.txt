Vertex AI

Vertex AI API

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

The Vertex API for accessing Claude is nearly-identical to the [Messages API](/en/api/messages) and supports all of the same options, with two key differences:

- In Vertex, `model` is not passed in the request body. Instead, it is specified in the Google Cloud endpoint URL.
- In Vertex, `anthropic_version` is passed in the request body (rather than as a header), and must be set to the value `vertex-2023-10-16`.

Vertex is also supported by Anthropic’s official [client SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks). This guide will walk you through the process of making a request to Claude on Vertex AI in either Python or TypeScript.

Note that this guide assumes you have already have a GCP project that is able to use Vertex AI. See [using the Claude 3 models from Anthropic](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude) for more information on the setup required, as well as a full walkthrough.

## [​](\#install-an-sdk-for-accessing-vertex-ai)  Install an SDK for accessing Vertex AI

First, install Anthropic’s [client SDK](/en/api/client-sdks) for your language of choice.

Python

Typescript

Copy

```Python
pip install -U google-cloud-aiplatform "anthropic[vertex]"

```

## [​](\#accessing-vertex-ai)  Accessing Vertex AI

### [​](\#model-availability)  Model Availability

Note that Anthropic model availability varies by region. Search for “Claude” in the [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) or go to [Use Claude 3](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude) for the latest information.

#### [​](\#api-model-names)  API model names

| Model | Vertex AI API model name |
| --- | --- |
| Claude 3 Haiku | claude-3-haiku@20240307 |
| Claude 3 Sonnet | claude-3-sonnet@20240229 |
| Claude 3 Opus (Public Preview) | claude-3-opus@20240229 |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620 |

### [​](\#making-requests)  Making requests

Before running requests you may need to run `gcloud auth application-default login` to authenticate with GCP.

The following examples shows how to generate text from Claude 3 Haiku on Vertex AI:

Python

Typescript

cURL

Copy

```Python
from anthropic import AnthropicVertex

project_id = "MY_PROJECT_ID"
# Where the model is running. e.g. us-central1 or europe-west4 for haiku
region = "MY_REGION"

client = AnthropicVertex(project_id=project_id, region=region)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-haiku@20240307",
    max_tokens=100,
    messages=[\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Hey Claude!",\
        }\
    ],
)
print(message)

```

See our [client SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks) and the official [Vertex AI docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs) for more details.
