Intro to Claude

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

This guide introduces Claude’s enterprise capabilities, the end-to-end flow for developing with Claude, and how to start building.

## [​](\#what-you-can-do-with-claude)  What you can do with Claude

Claude is designed to empower enterprises at scale with [strong performance](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/de8ba9b01c9ab7cbabf5c33b80b7bbc618857627/Model_Card_Claude_3.pdf) across benchmark evaluations for reasoning, math, coding, and fluency in English and non-English languages.

Here’s a non-exhaustive list of Claude’s capabilities and common uses.

| Capability | Enables you to… |
| --- | --- |
| Text and code generation | - Adhere to brand voice for excellent customer-facing experiences such as copywriting and chatbots<br>- Create production-level code and operate (in-line code generation, debugging, and conversational querying) within complex codebases<br>- Build automatic translation features between languages<br>- Conduct complex financial forecasts<br>- Support legal use cases that require high-quality technical analysis, long context windows for processing detailed documents, and fast outputs |
| Vision | - Process and analyze visual input, such as extracting insights from charts and graphs<br>- Generate code from images with code snippets or templates based on diagrams<br>- Describe an image for a user with low vision |
| Tool use | - Interact with external client-side tools and functions, allowing Claude to reason, plan, and execute actions by generating structured outputs through API calls |

## [​](\#model-options)  Model options

Enterprise use cases often mean complex needs and edge cases. Anthropic offers a range of models across the Claude 3 and Claude 3.5 families to allow you to choose the right balance of intelligence, speed, and [cost](https://www.anthropic.com/api).

### [​](\#claude-3-5-family)  Claude 3.5 Family

| **Description** | Coming soon… | Most intelligent model, combining top-tier performance with improved speed. Currently the only model in the Claude 3.5 family. | Coming soon… |
| **Example uses** | - | - Advanced research and analysis<br>- Complex problem-solving<br>- Sophisticated language understanding and generation<br>- High-level strategic planning | - |
| **Latest 1P API**<br>**model name** | - | `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` | - |
| **Latest AWS Bedrock**<br>**model name** | - | `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0` | - |
| **Vertex AI**<br>**model name** | - | `claude-3-5-sonnet@20240620` | - |

### [​](\#claude-3-family)  Claude 3 Family

|  | **Opus** | **Sonnet** | **Haiku** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Strong performance on highly complex tasks, such as math and coding. | Balances intelligence and speed for high-throughput tasks. | Near-instant responsiveness that can mimic human interactions. |
| **Example uses** | - Task automation across APIs and databases, and powerful coding tasks<br>- R&D, brainstorming and hypothesis generation, and drug discovery<br>- Strategy, advanced analysis of charts and graphs, financials and market trends, and forecasting | - Data processing over vast amounts of knowledge<br>- Sales forecasting and targeted marketing<br>- Code generation and quality control | - Live support chat<br>- Translations<br>- Content moderation<br>- Extracting knowledge from unstructured data |
| **Latest 1P API**<br>**model name** | `claude-3-opus-20240229` | `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` | `claude-3-haiku-20240307` |
| **Latest AWS Bedrock**<br>**model name** | `anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0` | `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` | `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` |
| **Vertex AI**<br>**model name** | `claude-3-opus@20240229` | `claude-3-sonnet@20240229` | `claude-3-haiku@20240307` |

## [​](\#enterprise-considerations)  Enterprise considerations

Along with an extensive set of features, tools, and capabilities, Claude is also built to be secure, trustworthy, and scalable for wide-reaching enterprise needs.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Secure** | - [Enterprise-grade](https://trust.anthropic.com/) security and data handling for API<br>- SOC II Type 2 certified, HIPAA compliance options for API<br>- Accessible through AWS (GA) and GCP (in private preview) |
| **Trustworthy** | - Resistant to jailbreaks and misuse. We continuously monitor prompts and outputs for harmful, malicious use cases that violate our [AUP](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).<br>- Copyright indemnity protections for paid commercial services<br>- Uniquely positioned to serve high trust industries that process large volumes of sensitive user data |
| **Capable** | - 200K token context window for expanded use cases, with future support for 1M<br>- [Tool use](/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use), also known as function calling, which allows seamless integration of Claude into specialized applications and custom workflows<br>- Multimodal input capabilities with text output, allowing you to upload images (such as tables, graphs, and photos) along with text prompts for richer context and complex use cases<br>- [Developer Console](https://console.anthropic.com) with Workbench and prompt generation tool for easier, more powerful prompting and experimentation<br>- [SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks) and [APIs](/en/api) to expedite and enhance development |
| **Reliable** | - Very low hallucination rates<br>- Accurate over long documents |
| **Global** | - Great for coding tasks and fluency in English and non-English languages like Spanish and Japanese<br>- Enables use cases like translation services and broader global utility |
| **Cost conscious** | - Family of models balances cost, performance, and intelligence |

## [​](\#implementing-claude)  Implementing Claude

1

Scope your use case

- Identify a problem to solve or tasks to automate with Claude.
- Define requirements: features, performance, and cost.

2

Design your integration

- Select Claude’s capabilities (e.g., vision, tool use) and models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) based on needs.
- Choose a deployment method, such as the Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, or Vertex AI.

3

Prepare your data

- Identify and clean relevant data (databases, code repos, knowledge bases) for Claude’s context.

4

Develop your prompts

- Use Workbench to create evals, draft prompts, and iteratively refine based on test results.
- Deploy polished prompts and monitor real-world performance for further refinement.

5

Implement Claude

- Set up your environment, integrate Claude with your systems (APIs, databases, UIs), and define human-in-the-loop requirements.

6

Test your system

- Conduct red teaming for potential misuse and A/B test improvements.

7

Deploy to production

- Once your application runs smoothly end-to-end, deploy to production.

8

Monitor and improve

- Monitor performance and effectiveness to make ongoing improvements.
