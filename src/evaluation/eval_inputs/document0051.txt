Using the API

Errors

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

## [​](\#http-errors)  HTTP errors

Our API follows a predictable HTTP error code format:

- 400 - `invalid_request_error`: There was an issue with the format or content of your request. We may also use this error type for other 4XX status codes not listed below.
- 401 - `authentication_error`: There’s an issue with your API key.
- 403 - `permission_error`: Your API key does not have permission to use the specified resource.
- 404 - `not_found_error`: The requested resource was not found.
- 413 - `request_too_large`: Request exceeds the maximum allowed number of bytes.
- 429 - `rate_limit_error`: Your account has hit a rate limit.
- 500 - `api_error`: An unexpected error has occurred internal to Anthropic’s systems.
- 529 - `overloaded_error`: Anthropic’s API is temporarily overloaded.

When receiving a [streaming](/en/api/streaming) response via SSE, it’s possible that an error can occur after returning a 200 response, in which case error handling wouldn’t follow these standard mechanisms.

## [​](\#error-shapes)  Error shapes

Errors are always returned as JSON, with a top-level `error` object that always includes a `type` and `message` value. For example:

JSON

Copy

```JSON
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "not_found_error",
    "message": "The requested resource could not be found."
  }
}

```

In accordance with our [versioning](/en/api/versioning) policy, we may expand the values within these objects, and it is possible that the `type` values will grow over time.

## [​](\#request-id)  Request id

Every API response includes a unique `request-id` header. This header contains a value such as `req_018EeWyXxfu5pfWkrYcMdjWG`. When contacting support about a specific request, please include this ID to help us quickly resolve your issue.
