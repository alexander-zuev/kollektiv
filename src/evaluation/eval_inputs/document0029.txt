## [​](\#model-names)  Model names

| Model | Anthropic API | AWS Bedrock | GCP Vertex AI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.

## [​](\#model-comparison)  Model comparison

Here is a visualization comparing cost vs. speed across Claude 3 and 3.5 models, showcasing the range in tradeoffs between cost and intelligence:

### [​](\#model-comparison-table)  Model comparison table

To help you choose the right model for your needs, we’ve compiled a table comparing the key features and capabilities of each model in the Claude family:

|  | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Claude 3 Opus | Claude 3 Sonnet | Claude 3 Haiku |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Description** | Most intelligent model | Powerful model for highly complex tasks | Balance of intelligence and speed | Fastest and most compact model for near-instant responsiveness |
| **Strengths** | Highest level of intelligence and capability | Top-level performance, intelligence, fluency, and understanding | Strong utility, balanced for scaled deployments | Quick and accurate targeted performance |
| **Multilingual** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Vision** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **API model name** | `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` | `claude-3-opus-20240229` | `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` | `claude-3-haiku-20240307` |
| **API format** | Messages API | Messages API | Messages API | Messages API |
| **Comparative latency** | Fast | Moderately fast | Fast | Fastest |
| **Context window** | 200K | 200K | 200K | 200K |
| **Max output** | 8192 tokens | 4096 tokens | 4096 tokens | 4096 tokens |
| **Cost (Input / Output per MTok)** | $3.00 / $15.00 | $15.00 / $75.00 | $3.00 / $15.00 | $0.25 / $1.25 |
| **Training data cut-off** | Apr 2024 | Aug 2023 | Aug 2023 | Aug 2023 |

## [​](\#prompt-and-output-performance)  Prompt and output performance

The Claude 3 family excels in:

- **​Benchmark performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the [Claude 3 model card](https://anthropic.com/claude-3-model-card/) for more information.

- **Engaging responses**: Claude 3 models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.
  - If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to our [prompt engineering guides](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
- **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to the Claude 3 family, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.


* * *

## [​](\#legacy-models)  Legacy models

We recommend migrating to the Claude 3 family of models. However, we understand that some users may need time to transition from our legacy models:

- **Claude Instant 1.2**: A fast and efficient model predecessor of Claude Haiku.
- **Claude 2.0**: The strong-performing predecessor to Claude 3.
- **Claude 2.1**: An updated version of Claude 2 with improved accuracy and consistency.

These models do not have the vision capabilities of the Claude 3 family and are generally slower, less performant and intelligent.

The [model deprecation page](/en/docs/model-deprecations) contains information on when legacy models will be deprecated.
