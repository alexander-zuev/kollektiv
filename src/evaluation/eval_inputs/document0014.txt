Prompt engineering

Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## [​](\#why-chain-prompts)  Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude’s full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

## [​](\#when-to-chain-prompts)  When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude’s full attention!

**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.

## [​](\#how-to-chain-prompts)  How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude’s performance.

### [​](\#example-chained-workflows)  Example chained workflows:

- **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
- **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
- **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
- **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
- **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.

### [​](\#advanced-self-correction-chains)  Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

Example: Self-correcting research summary

#### Prompt 1

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Summarize this medical research paper.<br><paper>{{RESEARCH\_PAPER}}</paper><br>Focus on methodology, findings, and clinical implications. |
| Assistant<br>{{SUMMARY}} | Methodology: Double-blind RCT with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received novel GLP-1/GIP dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received standard GLP-1 agonist. 24-week trial, primary endpoint: HbA1c reduction.<br>Findings:<br>\- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br>\- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br>\- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c <7%<br>\- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br>\- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br>Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, no serious events attributed to treatment.<br>Clinical Implications: Dual agonist shows superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard therapy. Could be a game-changer, especially for obese diabetics. |

#### Prompt 2

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Your task is to provide feedback on a research paper summary. Here is a summary of a medical research paper:<br><summary><br>{{SUMMARY}}<br></summary><br>Here is the research paper:<br><paper><br>{{RESEARCH\_PAPER}}<br></paper><br>Review this summary for accuracy, clarity, and completeness on a graded A-F scale. |
| Assistant<br>{{FEEDBACK}} | 1\. Accuracy: A<br> \- Correctly reported key stats: HbA1c reductions, weight loss.<br> \- Accurately noted safety profile and lack of serious adverse events.<br> \- Assertion of “game-changer” is justified by significantly better outcomes.<br>2\. Clarity: A-<br> \- Concise and well-structured with clear sections.<br> \- Good use of comparative language (e.g., “up 3% from Q1”) for context.<br> \- Minor issue: Acronyms like “RCT,” “GLP-1,” and “GIP” not defined. Consider spelling out first use.<br>3\. Completeness: B+<br> \- Covers all requested areas: methodology, findings, clinical implications.<br> \- Missing: Baseline characteristics of groups (were they well-matched?).<br> \- Missing: Any secondary endpoints (e.g., blood pressure, lipids).<br> \- Consider: Long-term implications or need for further research.<br>Overall, the summary is accurate and clear, providing key insights for a quick grasp of the study. To elevate to A+, define acronyms, mention group baseline stats, note any secondary outcomes, and briefly touch on the need for long-term studies. |

#### Prompt 3

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Your task is to improve a paper summary given feedback. Here is the first draft of a medical research paper:<br><summary><br>{{SUMMARY}}<br></summary><br>Here is the research paper:<br><paper><br>{{RESEARCH\_PAPER}}<br></paper><br>Here is the feedback:<br><feedback><br>{{FEEDBACK}}<br></feedback><br>Update the summary based on the feedback. |
| Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial’s primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.<br>Findings:<br>\- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br>\- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br>\- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c <7%<br>\- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br>\- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br>Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.<br>Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.<br>Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

#### Prompt 2

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Draft a strategy review document for engineering leadership based on this analysis of a multitenancy strategy.<br><strategy><br>{{STRATEGY}}<br></strategy><br><analysis><br>{{ANALYSIS}}<br></analysis><br>Include an executive summary, detailed analysis, and recommendations. |
| Assistant<br>{{STRATEGY\_DOC}} | \# Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product<br>\## Executive Summary<br>The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br>\## Detailed Analysis<br>\### 1\. Scalability: B+<br>Strengths:<br>\- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br>\- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br>\- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br>\### 2\. Security: B-<br>Strengths:<br>\- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br>\- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br>\- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br>\- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br>\### 3\. Cost-effectiveness: B<br>Strengths:<br>\- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br>\- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br>Weaknesses:<br>\- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br>\- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br>\- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br>\## Recommendations<br>1\. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br>2\. **Security Hardening**:<br> a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br> b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br> c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br>3\. **Cost Optimization**:<br> a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br> b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br> c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br>4\. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br> a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br> b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br> c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br>With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

#### Prompt 3

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Grade this strategy review document for clarity, actionability, and alignment with enterprise priorities. <br><priorities><br>{{PRIORITIES}}<br></priorities><br><strategy\_doc><br>{{STRATEGY\_DOC}}<br></strategy\_doc> |
| Assistant | 1\. Clarity: A<br> \+ Clear structure with Executive Summary, Detailed Analysis, and Recommendations.<br> \+ Analysis uses a grading system (B+, B-) for quick grasp of strengths/weaknesses.<br> \+ Technical terms (RBAC, ABAC, TLS) are explained or contextualized, aiding non-technical leadership.<br> \+ Visual aids (bullet points, indentation) enhance readability.<br>2\. Actionability: A-<br> \+ Recommendations are specific and technical (e.g., “Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes”).<br> \+ PoC plan with clear objectives provides a roadmap.<br> \+ Missing: Timelines, resource requirements, or team assignments for each recommendation.<br> \+ Consider: Add a “Next Steps” section with immediate actions, roles, and a high-level timeline.<br>3\. Enterprise Alignment: A+<br> \+ Directly addresses enterprise priorities:<br> \- Scalability: Discusses handling enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br> \- Security: Focuses on data isolation, encryption, and enterprise IAM.<br> \- Cost: Strategies align with enterprise FinOps (reserved instances, right-sizing).<br> \+ PoC with “high-scale simulation” and security audit shows commitment to enterprise-grade quality.<br> \+ Language resonates with enterprise concerns: “unacceptable risk,” “enterprise-grade,” “instill confidence.”<br>Overall, the document excels in clarity and enterprise alignment. The actionability is strong but could be elevated to A+ with a “Next Steps” section. The technical depth, coupled with clear explanations, makes this highly effective for both technical and non-technical leadership. Great work! |
