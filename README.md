## üåü Overview

Kollektiv is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for one purpose - allow you to chat with your
favorite docs (of libraries, frameworks, tools primarily) easily.

This project aims to allow LLMs to tap into the most up-to-date knowledge in 2 clicks so that you don't have to
worry about incorrect replies, hallucinations or inaccuracies when working with the best LLMs.

## ‚ùìWhy?
This project was born out of a **personal itch** - whenever a new feature of my favorite library comes up, I know I
can't rely on the LLM to help me build with it - because it simply doesn't know about it!

**The root cause** - LLMs lack access to the most recent documentation or private knowledge, as they are trained on a
set of data that was accumulated way back (sometimes more than a year ago).

**The impact** - hallucinations in answers, inaccurate, incorrect or outdated information, which directly decreases
productivity and usefulness of using LLMs

**But there is a better way...**

What if LLMs could tap into a source of up-to-date information on libraries, tools, frameworks you are building with?

Imagine your LLM could intelligently decide when it needs to check the documentation source and always provide an
accurate reply?

## üéØ Goal
Meet Kollektiv -> an open-source RAG app that helps you easily:
- parse the docs of your favorite libraries
- efficiently stores and embeds them in a local vector storage
- sets up an LLM chat which you can rely on

**Note** this is v.0.1.6 and reliability of the system can be characterized as following:
- in 50% of the times it works every time!

So do let me know if you are experiencing issues and I'll try to fix them.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **üï∑Ô∏è Intelligent Web Crawling**: Utilizes FireCrawl API to efficiently crawl and extract content from specified documentation websites.
- **üß† Advanced Document Processing**: Implements custom chunking strategies to optimize document storage and retrieval.
- **üîç Vector Search**: Employs Chroma DB for high-performance similarity search of document chunks.
- **üîÑ Multi-Query Expansion**: Enhances search accuracy by generating multiple relevant queries for each user input.
- **üìä Smart Re-ranking**: Utilizes Cohere's re-ranking API to improve relevancy of search results
- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Responses**: Integrates with Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate human-like, context-aware responses.
- **üß† Dynamic system prompt**: Automatically summarizes the embedded documentation to improve RAG decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI
- **Storage**:
  - Supabase (auth/data)
  - ChromaDB (vectors)
  - Redis (queues/real-time)
- **AI/ML**:
  - OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (embeddings)
  - Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (chat)
  - Cohere (re-ranking)
- **UI**: Chainlit
- **Additional**: tiktoken, pydantic, pytest, ruff

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexander-zuev/kollektiv.git
   cd kollektiv
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
   ```bash
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your_firecrawl_api_key"
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
   COHERE_API_KEY="your_cohere_api_key"
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   poetry run kollektiv
   ```

## üí° Usage

1. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   # Run both API and Chainlit UI
   poetry run kollektiv

   # Or run only Chainlit UI
   chainlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Add Documentation:**
   ```bash
   @docs add https://your-docs-url.com
   ```
   The system will guide you through:
   - Setting crawling depth
   - Adding exclude patterns (optional)
   - Processing and embedding content

3. **Manage Documents:**
   ```bash
   @docs list                  # List all documents
   @docs remove [ID]          # Remove a document
   @help                      # Show all commands
   ```

4. **Chat with Documentation:**
   Simply ask questions in natural language. The system will:
   - Search relevant documentation
   - Re-rank results for accuracy
   - Generate contextual responses

## ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Current Limitations

- Image content not supported (text-only embeddings)
- No automatic re-indexing of documentation
- URL validation limited to common formats
- Exclude patterns must start with `/`

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
For a brief roadmap please check out [project wiki page](https://github.com/alexander-zuev/kollektiv/wiki).

## üìà Performance Metrics
Evaluation is currently done using `ragas` library. There are 2 key parts assessed:
1. End-to-end generation
   - Faithfulness
   - Answer relevancy
   - Answer correctness
2. Retriever (TBD)
   - Context recall
   - Context precision

## Project Renaming Notice

The project has been renamed from **OmniClaude** to **Kollektiv** to:
- avoid confusion / unintended copyright infringement of Anthropic
- emphasize the goal to become a tool to enhance collaboration through simplifying access to knowledge
- overall cool name (isn't it?)

If you have any questions regarding the renaming, feel free to reach out.
